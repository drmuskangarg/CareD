"Me and mom heard that a facility care needed a new refrigerator and we had one that could be donated.

We went there to visit and know the owner.

They run mostly on donations. Its a simple, big old house, it was a little messy but clean.
They have 24 patients, mostly Alzheimer...
I dont know how much they charge for them, perhaps whatever people can afford.
The guy that runs it showed us the place and as he greeted them also shared snipets of their stories

""This one? Sleeping peacefully...is terrible! Rips his clothes all the time""

""That one the daugther couldnt handle anymore and sent him here. Stays in the couch all day""

""This one was once a neurologist, his son is also a doctor in the city""

Another one was wandering and saying he was in pain, spitted...He tried grab something in the lil orchard and the owner said: ""Hey mister! Dont touch it, you have already ruined the grapes other day hah! I will send you the bills!""

Reply: ""Huh? Sure I will pay! I will pay them all, domt worry!""

""He has all the money in the world, hasnt he?"" 

Lol

Its a big dude with a big heart. When he discovered the place they didnt have food, bills were overdue and place was dirty. He and his wife (nurse) took responsability and talked with the attorney to ease on the place or something. The first day they needed to pour water in the milk to give them...


Seeing some of them made me think of my dad (66) he is severely impaired already but my mom as main caregiver can still take care at home. I was thankfull that my dad don't cause many troubles, the incontinence is the hardest part. He is quiet and stays bed most of the day, he can still eat on his own with a bowl & spoon and walk around.

Few days later he came by and we gave him the refrigerator and some clothes, more to come. Its not much but we want to do it more often from now on. We felt better they will have more tools to work on them",0
"Hi, I watched ""The Father"" recently and it made me very curious about dementia. I guess it's one of my biggest fears, to lose myself. What I want to ask is how would someone with dementia react if you would show them a video that they recorded when everything was fine and they see themselves talking and explaining the situation. Would that work and make things easier ?

Has it been tried already ?

"Hello all. My grandma has been diagnosed with early frontal lobe dementia . (FTD) and I had a few questions. My mother will be her main caretaker along with myself and my 4 siblings. I wanted to ask anyone to share their experiences with anyone they know who had or has FTD and what to expect. I guess my main questions are: 
Will my grandma be in pain throughout her final years?
Will my grandma forget me? 
And 
Do all FTD patients exhibit anger and rage?

Someone please give me some guidance. What should I do for her? What should I look out for? How do I advocate for her? How do I help her? I feel so lost. She doesn't want me sharing this news with family/friends so I have no support system right now. I'm just feeling helpless in this situation.",0
"My 94 year old grandmother was put on Risperidone almost three weeks ago. I am with her in rural Germany. She was sad, paranoid, suicidal, and kind of aggressive before, but has been doing really well. I’m not sure if this is due to the medication or because my mom and I are here taking care of her (we live in the US and arrived at the same time she started taking the medication). It did seem noticeable the one day she missed, but not sure if that’s just personal bias. There are no specialists nearby and she was prescribed the medication by a GP.  I know that there are many risks associated with this drug, and while im glad it seems to really be helping, im wondering if it was appropriate to put her on this drug before any other medication, or if im just overly concerned and not trusting of rural doctor who isn’t a specialist for dementia patients. I appreciate any insight/advice!",0
"Dad has recently moved to a residential home that can cater for his vascular dementia. As he has a share in the property that Mum still lives in, his care costs need to be paid. He has around £17k a year in private pension income that he pays tax on. My siblings and I all have financial and medical powers of attorney for both our parents. Can I set up a charity for dad's care that can have his taxable income paid to, and then spend all income on meeting part of the care costs, whilst recovering the tax deducted and paying that to the care home as well? The tax recovered would pay for 2 weeks or so of care a year if we can do this in the UK?",0

"I ended up calling the crisis hotline on the Monday from last week. The thoughts of killing my grandmother began to change to concrete plans. I was so afraid of my own head that I admitted myself voluntarily to a mental hospital.

I have been released, now. I stayed there for about a week. I was discharged yesterday evening. The hospital bans patients from accessing the internet and their cellphones. Contact with the outside world was limited. I only got to talk to my immediate family members via landline phone in the hospital, and my family was allowed to visit me in person at limited, scheduled times. It was sort of a 'prison' but the staff treated everyone with kindness, and the goal is to help us patients feel better, and stabilize us, so we can get back to our normal lives.

There were all sorts of weird rules we had to follow. It was insanely strict. I was banned from flossing my teeth because dental floss is considered a contraband item. The best I could for my dental needs was brush my teeth. I understood why, though. It's to keep all of the patients safe. Most of us aren't exactly of sound mind when we're first admitted. It's to prevent us from harming others or ourselves.

Now that I'm out, I'm so glad that I admitted myself. I'm safe. My grandma is safe. And the treatment I received in the hospital really opened my eyes. I learned a lot from the group therapy sessions about myself. I've opened up to my family a lot more during the duration of my stay.

I have also figured out the source of my thoughts worsening like this. It was the medicine. The doctor assigned to me in the hospital put me on a different SSRI to treat my depression (I now officially have major depression disorder). This new one erased the urge to kill my grandmother completely.

My mom has finally put her foot down on getting my grandma in a nursing home. She's expecting to have her living there starting on Wednesday. That's tomorrow.

I was able to go home with my family and see my grandma again. She was so happy to have me back. She gave me a huge hug, smiling, on the verge of tears. She doesn't know the exact reason why I was missing for a whole week. All we've told her was I needed to go to the hospital for a little bit. She luckily hasn't asked for more details.

Honestly, I was a bit anxious about meeting her again. I wasn't sure how I would react. But once I saw her smile and felt her warmth, I was happy, too. I was happy to see her happy.

I've learned to not call her a husk. She's not 'already dead.' She is still alive, yes. It's just that this version of her isn't the grandma I remember. Even so, the best I can do is make her as comfortable as possible when her dementia has progressed this bad. Killing her isn't a solution. It isn't a show of mercy. It's wrong. I've figured that out, speaking to the therapists and doctors at the mental hospital.

I'd like to thank everyone again that sent me advice in the original post. Looking back at that crazed state of mind: the past me almost feels like a complete stranger.

I feel so, so much better now.

I've never felt this close to my family before my entire life.

It's liberating. Like a massive weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. 

Of course this doesn't mean that everything has been settled just yet. We're still sorting out the finances of putting her in the nursing home. I also have this huge hospital bill to pay now...

But it's ok.

I'd prefer this over causing my family, or myself, even further distress from doing something that I'd regret, and cause irreversible damage. In the end everyone is safe and alive, and that's all that matters.

I've weathered the storm. It's transformed into a rainbow, now, and it's so bright and colorful and full of hope.

I know not everyday will be like this. Life will always throw more challenges my way because, well, it's just 'life.' Even so, I can't let it get me down. No matter how many more trials I run into, no matter how many more low days are thrown my way, I'll always keep this one phrase in my mind to help me power through it:

'If I really, truly believe that I can achieve something, I can make it happen. I just need to put the appropriate amount of effort behind it.'

So... I can change the way I think. I can control my depression and be there for my grandma - as much as I can be at least. I understand that her angry outbursts are a trigger for me so I'll prioritize my own needs, in those moments. I'll ask my family for help if things get too rough.

Again... Thank you all.",0

"I was helping Mom gather her tax documents and I noticed her investment account was empty.   She said she had no idea where her money was.   We called the custodian and they said the money had been moved and they gave us the name of the new custodian.

We called the new custodian and Mom did have an account but the email address and the phone number belonged to my sister’s ex-husband.   Mom slowly remembered that the sister brought her to fill out forms at the new custodian and said her ex-husband would manage her money because he was good with that.    If Mom lost her mind or passed away, there would be no way any of that money would be traceable.

When we got Mom’s email address put back on the account, the system notified the old email address of the update.  Now the sister is pulling out all the stops trying to get back on the account including calling Mom, harassing her and denigrating me.    

I’m not sure what to do.    If I file for a conservatorship, that sister will use Mom’s money to get a lawyer to fight it.   She will tell Mom that I was always just after her money and get Mom all riled up.

I can send her a letter requesting that she stop.     I don’t think Mom is competent any more to understand money decisions.    My relationship with Mom is the most important but that sister will destroy it at any opportunity.    If Mom loses it, she will get a guardianship and not inform me where she puts Mom.   I’m very distressed by this.

I would love to hear any advice/experiences.   The sister is local and I am not.   I’ve been trying to get Mom to move in with me but she doesn’t want to.",0
"Now, I wouldn't say I disagree, in some ways it's just way too obvious; not even counting that everyone around me is becoming fairly aggravated by the usual suspects.

I feel if I can make it to the medicare age still somewhat functional, then most of the disaster can be remediated.

Also, what are some things I can do or setup that will make it easier to know when its time to step back from various responsibilities?   I know power of attorney things are involved, and that makes me more than a bit distressed; but I also don't want to wake up one morning in a good, pleasant state and realize I spent a thousand bucks on a goldfish or something last night.",0
"Hi,
For my university psychology degree we have to create a Dragons Den idea using psychology to help people. My group have created a digital photo frame to help people with dementia. On it's lock screen, it would simply be a digital clock with large font. However, connected to the app it would allow photos/videos/audio notes to be sent over of family and friends and allow music associated with the photos to be played, in the hopes of helping recall in early stages of dementia. The front of the photo frame would also clip off to be decorated as there is lots of research between crafts and increased neutral pathways in people with dementia.

I was hoping for your help and feedback. Is this something you would deem useful, either in regards to your peace of mind and/or the recall itself? Are there any improvements you think could be made? 

Thanks for your help 🙂",0

"Hi all, 

I am so relieved and glad I found this community. I’m reaching out for advice on behalf of my mother. My stepdad has recently been diagnosed with FTD. He’s always been very bad with money, but the erratic and irresponsible spending has worsened, and he is unable to be truthful and forthright. She is doing her best to get control of his finances. She has power of attorney, and has the information for a handful of his accounts and has either managed/shut them down. However, he has a number of online accounts/PayPal, and possibly others she does not know about. He’s somewhat of a tech whiz and she is worried he’ll find ways to continue to subvert/hide spending. They’re in a poor financial situation as it is. Are there any specific resources that could pull all of those accounts/financial tools under her control?",0
"During the years that I cared for her, the only ""Mom"" in my consciousness was the one I dealt with day to day. I was afraid that that would be all I was left with in the end--that the stranger who took over my mom's body would also supplant all my memories of her. But, ever since she passed, in January, I have had so many memories come popping up, of good times we had before this terrible thing happened to her. It has been a source of great joy and comfort for me. 

So, if you are entertaining similar worries about losing your loved one, be assured that those memories of better days are still there, and may bring you some comfort at the most unexpected time.",0

"We admitted my dad in memory care two weeks ago. Physically he looks “normal” - no walker, wheelchair, but his mind is going quick. So far, I’ve visited 4-5 times a week but the last few times he’s been asking me to break him out. Today, he wanted me to bring him out and I got so frustrated explaining to him that I can’t, I left memory care, cried the entire way home to my husband and kids, swearing that I need a break from visiting, at least for a couple of days. The emotional toll is unreal. 

I booked a conference room at the facility for his 71st birthday in a few weeks. It’s in the assisted living side, not memory care so I’m fully responsible for him and getting him back to his room. We didn’t invite many people, mostly his siblings, and none of them live local. I’ve felt judged by them for putting my dad in a home but those feelings might be my guilt eating up at me. I stand by my decision. It’s just hard. 

I’m starting to think this “party” is a terrible idea. In my head, I see this wholesome, “Brady bunch” event but I continue to have high expectations for this disease and it bites me in the ass every single time.

I want my dad to see his siblings. Just nervous if he focuses on getting out the whole time. Wish he would enjoy the moment but, like I said, my expectations are too high. This is my first time dealing w this disease and it sucks.

Should I have the party? Should I change my approach w anything? I was going to tell the attendees that he is in no way allowed outside the room unless he is with me.

"It is 2am and I can’t sleep because of today/yesterday. Yesterday, I toured an assisted living facility. It was immaculate. The residents all looked happy. The staff was friendly but not overly friendly. My parents were never very picky people. I knew my Dad would love this place. Dad has greatly warmed up to the idea of assisted living. Dad has done his best to care for mom at home with my help and the help of several aids. However Dad has his own issues I’ve written about before here and he can not do it any more. And nor do I want him to, nor did I ever from the beginning but he insisted. It is out of the question for them to stay home. Their house is falling apart from neglect. Mom doesn’t do anything but sit all day. They can’t afford to maintain private care at the level she needs it any more. Dad has been hospitalized several times in the last few years for lifelong mental illness exasperated by the stress of mom’s dementia. 

So, tour went fabulously. Facility is a little expensive but we can make this work for quite a long time with a tight budget. Yes, they will have to sell their house eventually and use up all their money. It is what it is. Medicaid doesn’t cover the cost of rent anywhere here, there are no assisted living facilities here that participate with Medicaid, only nursing homes, as I’ve learned.

I made a big mistake assuming my mom who had expressed being okay with this in the past would be easy. The director suggested I bring my dad back to look, and I extended him that offer, he insisted my mom comes along. 

So off we go with mom dad and the aid. Well mom began to fret. She liked the place enough but then she started saying “I don’t know about this” and that she isn’t ready and asking how much does this cost? My mom hasn’t paid a bill in years. I was quite shocked. I didn’t know how to react. The aid was upset. I’m not sure why exactly. The aid works with an agency, and was very negative. She has been with mom for about 2 months and mom is currently attached to her and thinks she’s a friend.Mom wanted to make sure her “friend” could come. (She can’t, that’s not affordable) and began saying things like “I’m a single woman” and “this is too much” “I don’t want to spend the rest of my life here” “I never thought this would happen to me”

My dad can not handle her any more. He sees this place as his saving grace. And she is fighting it! Her personality has completely changed. We had to bring her back home and drop the subject because she was so worked up. Dad is going to work on warming her up, but we are going to do a 30 day respite stay that I hope will evolve into a permanent one. Dad is calling it a vacation. 

And I am sick with anxiety and sadness over it. This is not my mom. My mom was a strong, difficult woman who never was quite right to begin with but I want her back. This sucks.",0
"This is a sort of accountability post for myself.  I just started getting outside help for my mother, having never had to organize activities and people helping, for anyone else before. it was difficult for me to kick myself into action because it’s confusing and new.  i tried to roll with it. i did. and now it keeps getting more confusing, with schedule changes and people who i try to trust recommending different things, and i just want to cancel everything again, quit my part time job, and just sink back into my people pleasing attitude with my mother and take care of her full time. but i’m not going to. dammit. this shit’s so confusing and emotionally laden. thank you for reading. good luck to all of us out there.",0
"My dad wakes up each day and begs staff to call me to visit. When I do visit he yells and screams at me that I’ve abandoned him. He says he never asked for this and can live on his own. He clearly cannot. 

When I leave he yells and cries for me to stay. He is going on his fourth week of living there, so not long. He has had 2 good days. 

He has tried to leave the facility three times. The last time he left, he struck at a caregiver and it took five people to get him back inside the facility. He was sent to the ER for evaluation and had to be sedated to be returned to his ASF. He does wear a wander alarm bracelet. 

His doctor has now prescribed Seroquel and Ativan. The facility nurse has asked me not to visit for a week, or two, as they work out dosage. I am not forbidden to visit, but my presence sets him off. 

He will be moved to the memory care area next month when a bed opens. Hospice has been started as of yesterday. 

I hate dementia so much. I have PTSD from the hospital experience and extreme anxiety when I see the facility’s number appear on my phone. 

I am happy to stay away from the facility, but wracked with guilt for not visiting him.",0

"Well tomorrow my wonderful mum is going to view her very sheltered accommodation. We have told her extensive building work is going to start on her property and removal men are coming at 9.30 Monday morning to transfer her furniture and things to other house. She was not happy at first but we said it's only for 8-10 weeks and she will be back. The house she is in has lots of steps up to front door, it's cold and only gets sunshine in the evening and she has said for many months now she hates it. She has vascular dementia, can't cook, can't use phone anymore, can't do her own meds, shopping, finances... and is so lonely we go by as often as we can but it's not enough.

I feel like such a shit. I just don't want to have her so upset while her things are getting shifted. I am doing this as I want my mum to be safe, comfortable and not lonely and frightened in the last few years she may have left and I can't give her the care she needs anymore.

"Just an observation. The boredom I see my mother struggle with is sometimes kind of sad. She's 68, lives with us, and is early/mid stage. She used to sell books online, get on Facebook, go to yard sales, crochet, call family... and all sorts of things to keep herself busy.

We've bought her supplies for crochet, but she forgets she has them. I have a really nice computer set up in her room, but she uses it once every couple months at best. She can't really drive anymore (because although she's an amazing driver, she can't remember where she's going or where she came from). She has her own cell phone, but most of the time forgets she has it... and when she does remember, she can't remember how to look up numbers in the phone book.

So she spends a lot of time on the sofa watching TV... but she doesn't really know how to operate it other than on/off. When she gets bored with the program, she just turns the TV off because she can't figure out how to change the channel.

She does still clean... and sometimes has moments of lucidity... but those moments are fewer and farther between as time goes on. She makes the best of her situation and has a good demeanor... but it's still sad to go through the living room and see her bored on the sofa, just sitting there because she doesn't know what to do.",0
"Location:  Southern California

My friend's mom suffered a stroke a few years ago which effected her short-term memory.  Over time her memory has gotten worse and she now also has issues with bodily functions.  Recently her mom walked out of their home and they had to contact the authorities who in turn issued a Silver Alert.  She was found and became VERY irate with the police; at first she didn't want to return to the home.  

We're realizing with this incident her mom needs a Memory Care Facility.  Its breaking her heart but the care of her mom has steadily become overwhelming.

"(2nd attempt to post as spam filter caught the 1st try, not selling anything here! 😁)

Hi everybody,

My mom was diagnosed spring 2022 and lives alone in a different city, so I started using “smart home tech” to make sure she was ok and can be notified of any issues. While discussing my installation in my local support group, the feedback I received was very interesting and the one thing which stood out was that I was alone thinking this way and using these tools.

From there I documented what I did and converted a hobby into something I hope will prove useful for all in our common context, and published it at **www(dot)alzheimerstech(dot)com** (trying this due to spam filter). 

This site is my personal initiative which will hopefully lend a hand to others and there is no commercial angle to this at all.  I simply wish to give back and help. Yes Echo is mentioned and I use it at my mom's house :)

Any feedback is of course appreciated and feel free to share with anyone or any organization you feel may benefit from this information.

Cheers,

"Hello!  My mother was hospitalized a couple months ago, and the geriatrician removed her from her memantine that she took twice a day. He said that since she's been on it for several years, it would no longer be helpful since the efficacy fades and she has heart/kidney issues.

I''ve noticed some decline in her since then, and I mentioned it to the primary, who wrote a script for mementine XR a week ago (Walgreens hasn't gotten it in yet...)

I'm just curious if anyone has experienced a difference between the extended release and the regular release? 

Her current doctor says that the body processes the extended release better. Just wondering what everyone's experience is.  Thanks so much!",0
"After a grueling week of ER visits, treatments that created new problems, frustration and tears - we finally signed Dad up for hospice.

What troubles me or puzzles me - is why no one talks about hospice.  My sister's theory is no one (care home, assisted living, ER, doctor) is 'allowed' or comfortable saying 'perhaps hospice is right for you and your LO.'  As my sister stood in the ER with a very unhappy, confused LO, the doctors discussed all the tests, the possible diagnoses, etc.  for a 91 year old with pretty bad dementia.  Being in healthcare, my sister asked ""what about palliative care?  How much can he take here?  Your last treatment caused more problems.""  and suddenly the floodgates opened - the doctor's eyes widened and he said ""well your Dad IS eligible for hospice.""  

I read all your venting posts here - so much frustration when - as least for US Medicare patients - hospice is 100% covered.  I understand there's no clear 'time' but for people with severe dementia - they are not going to get better.  Surgeries, blood thinners, whatever - are not going to fix their biggest problem - the brain deterioration.  While I would never suggest you give up on your LO, I also know - at least for my Dad - he never, never have wanted to be living the life he's stuck with now. 

Anyway, I'm doing this post for you all - to tell you that you will need to ask, inquire, prod about hospice.  No one is going to steer you to it (at least in my experience). 

Sorry if I offended or am out of line - just trying to educate and help.",0
"Crossposting from r/CareAides:

 I'm  not a CA, only a housekeeper. Just started last week. Today I had what  was described to me as a ""perpetually angry"" resident asking how to gain access to a locked maintenance room. I apologized and explained that  the door was locked (and what the room was), and the patient became very irate. Not knowing what  else to do I excused myself quickly from the situation as the patient  was in a wheelchair.

Could I have  handled this differently? I have little experience with severe dementia,  however I'd really like to continue working with seniors.",0
"My husband was diagnosed today with Vascular dementia. He is 45, currently active duty military. He has a TBI and a stroke that he had sometime between 2004-July 2022( the stroke was discovered in July 2022 when he had an MRI to evaluate him for the TBI. The stroke was not present on a CT scan/MRI he had in 2004.)I’ve searched through the post here and notice that most of the posts are for older people and not quite his age group. Other than being told not to take any impacts to his head and to not have any more strokes, they really didn’t tell us anything else. I have tons of questions. What do I need to be looking for as his primary caregiver? What does his quality of life look like? Is he going to make it to 80-90 years old? Is he just going to wake up one day and not be himself? What do I need to do for our future to make him as comfortable and prepared for what’s to come? Am I missing something? What do I need to know to help him. Thank you everyone for your help.",0

I used to talk to my mom about these issues, she gave me the best advice but she passed away on February 7th.  My dad passed in October of 2022.  I just feel so overwhelmed and really don’t have anyone who understands what I’m going through.  

My dad passed from dementia but only had it about two years before he passed. It was so hard watching him and seeing what will eventually happen to my husband.

"Long post.

So I guess first disclosure about myself: I have a high level of paranoia surrounding health when it comes to myself and to my mother. I recently obsessed over a large eye freckle she had that ended up being years old and just racial melanesios. I just want to lay that out regarding myself. 

Now to my mother. My mom has had issues with memory for as long as I can remember. She is turning 58 this year, and I am turning 25. Even in middle school, I remember she once left the house with the stove on, but I was fortunately home to catch it. She’s forgotten her phone or purse somewhere random for as long as I can remember. But she never forgets critical things. 

This has made it hard to really know what is normal age related memory decline relative to her, and what is a level of worsening that is concerning…She also has had very severe depression for a long time and has gone through quite a lot of trauma in her life. She is also currently looking at potentially being diagnosed with either Rheumatoid Arthritis or Sjogrens Syndrome (which I believe can cause brain fog). 

These past few months, I’ve noticed a bit more repetition  happening, to be honest. But it’s usually been negligible information that I would understand forgetting. We talk a lot on the phone(a new development since I’ve moved away), and she frequently is doing things simultaneously. I guess I got particularly scared though when she asked me something, I explained it, and then she asked the same thing 5 minutes later. The next day, she didn’t ask me the question again per se, but she asked me to explain that answer again. I also do feel that I need to explain slightly, but not too complex, topics a bit more often as well. She doesn’t repeat stories constantly, but she on occasion may repeat a particular story she’s mentioned a few times before (I.e. sometime in recent months). That doesnt occur at a rate where I personally feel it stands out, but I’m not sure what the interval for concern should be here…I’m not sure what “normal” repetition is, if that makes sense. And I’ve never taken note if she was repeating it because it related to the topic at hand or because she genuinely doesn’t think she’s said it before. Is repetition concerning when it’s unprompted? 

In terms of other behavior though, I haven’t noticed anything. She still does everything in her life normally (and as a single mom, what she constantly does is A LOT). When she visits my city, she explores the surrounding area and gets back home perfectly fine. Even while driving past the places she walks alone she could pull over right there and figure out how to get back again alone. She had a million doctor appointments this month and she was able to remember all of them without issue. She’s already planning and thinking ahead about appointments strategically in relation to a planned trip. I guess I cant think of any other hallmark sign. Her mood is low since she has long-term depression, but nothing seems uncharacteristic. She watches movies and dramas frequently and can easily explain them to me. 

I guess the slight uptick in repetition and her 25 MMSE score have me worried. The doctor said while 25 is a bit below average, she thinks it is probably  just her  heavy depression and immense stress. I’m wondering if English being her second language and her low education play a role in this as well. My mother has still opted to see a neurologist though, thankfully. 

I guess I’m reaching out because tbh, this worry is eating me up everyday. I am in law school, and I can’t even focus on class anymore. My brother lives with her right now and said he hasn’t noticed anything, she feels like she’s fine (and only asked to be checked because of my concern)…is it really just me? I would be really happy if it is… do y’all think early dementia should be low on the list of concerns here? I never grew up around aging people, so I have no frame of reference. my mom is all I’ve got, and I just feel paralyzed. Sorry if I really am over reacting. As someone with depression and anxiety, please understand my potential neuroticism…",0
"So… I have 2 kids (9f, 11m) and 1 boyfriend (45, aka grown up kid). Because my mom needed help I moved in, so we all moved in. Bf and I in 1 room, both kids in another. Definitely not an ideal situation (having the kids involved is a post all in it if itself) but we are doing what we need to get things situated. 

I’m not working right now and spend most of my day with my mom. He works from approx 8am - 6:30pm Mon - Sat. He has a very hard time dealing with my mother in her advanced dementia stage, so he mostly avoids her as much as he can. Fine, ok, whatever works for him. I, of course, don’t have the “luxury” of doing so.

The times he does interact with her are short and infrequent. BUT, he complains about it every time. Even if she’s only talking to me and he’s in the room he has to leave because he can’t “deal”. Tells me over and over how stressful it is for him. Wants me to do anything for him that involves the possibility of running into her in the house. He’s skipped meals because he won’t go in the kitchen when she’s there. Anytime he does get “stuck” talking to her he gets mad if I don’t come “save” him. 

I understand that he’s not comfortable with her, I get it, I really do. And I do what I can to keep him out of her line of fire. It’s just that when he complains to me about it I want to punch him in the nose!

Because, REALLY? I’m here with her all day! I know it’s stressful! He doesn’t even see the worst of it. He doesn’t even like me talking/venting to him about it. 

I’m the one with her all day, also taking care of 2 kids, cooking for everyone and keeping the house in order. My attention is always on someone else. And I also have to worry about making sure that he’s not overwhelmed? 

Seriously, he’s an adult, just deal with it. It makes me feel guilty that I can’t keep him comfortable. That’s on top of the guilt I have over having the kids going through this and ALL THAT is on top of the general parenting guilt I always have. 

And he wants to complain that it’s “too hard” to make his single cup of coffee if she’s in the kitchen in the morning.

I’m not asking him to, nor is it his responsibility to do anything to help with my mom. I just want him to keep his complaints to himself. When I’ve brought it up he says I’m trying to stifle his emotions. 

Am I going overboard asking him to keep his complaints to himself? 

Thinking about it, maybe this isn’t the right sub for this vent, but I feel like I’ll be understood.",0
"My mom is in the moderate stages of LBD, at the point where she needs help with essentially every aspect of life, but still cognizant of what’s going on around her and has opinions and feelings about what’s happening.  She’s in assisted living, but I am 100% in charge of her finances, her medical care, her everything. My aunt provides a lot of visits and socialization for her, but my mom still wants a lot of my attention and time, and she wants me to see the grandkids a lot. I have a local brother, he’s pretty useless.

My mother-in-law also had dementia, she passed away this fall. My husband is an only child and was doing what I am doing now for her for five years, so we were already pretty worn down before we got my moms diagnosis. My husband actually quit his job recently, after five years of taking care of his mom he was just exhausted and needs a break.

I am worried I’m in the same place, but one of us needs to keep working. Between my job and our kids (we have 1.5 year old twins) and my moms needs I just can’t manage it all. I can’t even visit my mom, it’s not at all enjoyable, but I feel so guilty because I know she wants to see me.

"My husbands uncle has dementia. His short term memory is about 5-10 minute loops but for the most part gone. He has this friend from Ukraine that he’s talked to for YEARS. Before the dementia got bad he had went and seen her roughly 10 years ago. She’s in Greece now and has been kinda encouraging him to see her again, which I wouldn’t have a problem with. I’m down to go to Greece. However, it’s getting to the point that he’s openly telling people that he will run on foot and have a friend pick him up to see her. All of his friends know he has dementia. They’d never agree to it. But he is kinda a flight risk. I don’t want to block his friend. But it seems to be encouraging this behavior to the point he says my husband and I are acting like overly protective strict parents because “his dementia isn’t that bad” his friend from Ukraine doesn’t realize how bad he is either I think.

"I thought it took longer for dementia to come on but it happened surprisingly quickly. I experienced it with my grandparents and now I'm experiencing it with my boyfriend/partner of 14 years. 

He's only 62, I'm 53 yo.  It seemed to start overnight. I was told he may have Myasthenia Gravis, then dementia. It feels like it neurological. I'm terrified.

We both used to work from home for the same company and he got fired. We have much less money coming in. I have health issues I need to take care of but, I have to keep working so money will keep coming in. 

I don't know where to start. We have to move in just a couple of months and there isn't enough money. To make matters worse we were new to this area and have no friends or family for support.

"Mom has had severe difficulty swallowing and is choking all the time on her food.  She has held firm on oral only feeding, no PEG, but is constantly hungry and thirsty and losing weight. 

She now has aspiration pneumonia, the most common cause of death for her type of degenerative disease. The studies on her disease say that most individuals die approximately two years after their first case of aspiration pneumonia, and those individual were all placed on some kind of feeding tube (again she has refused that).

Has anyone faced this before?

Edit:  she is on hospice and is on purée. Her swallowing mechanism at the base of her throat is failing and so she is choking and gurgling on even saliva.  So it’s reaching hours straight of very weakly trying to get saliva cleared out of her throat.  Morphine doesn’t seem to change anything.  

Peg really wouldn’t change the issue of choking on one’s own saliva.  

I’m realizing just now that hospice is supposed to talk me through this some more.  Our discussions are so heavy about what to do immediately it didn’t occur to me I could talk to them about how to steel myself for what happens next.

" Hi everybody,

My mom was diagnosed spring 2022 and lives alone in a different city, so I started using “smart home tech” to make sure she was ok and can be notified of any issues. While discussing my installation in my local support group, the feedback I received was very interesting and the one thing which stood out was that I was alone thinking this way and using these tools.

From there I documented what I did and converted a hobby into something I hope will prove useful for all in our common context, and published it at [www.alzheimerstech.com](http://www.alzheimerstech.com/). This site is my personal initiative which will hopefully lend a hand to others and there is no commercial angle to this at all.  I simply wish to give back and help.

Any feedback is of course appreciated and feel free to share with anyone or any organization you feel may benefit from this information.

Cheers,

How often do you take your early stage dementia relative/parent out of the house? It breaks my heart that he sometimes doesn’t leave the house for over a week. Do they need outings?

"Dad has been to the ER twice this week.  It started with edema/inflammation of his iliopsoas, no doubt from sitting all the time couple with congestive heart failure.  That also has causes edema on his lower legs/feet - for years - which then causes sores.  For years, he's not been able or willing to follow the plan for caring for his legs - won't elevate, won't wear the compressions socks, often won't let care givers apply the steroid cream.  So at the ER for the muscle pain, they find a blood infection (shocker).  So they put him on antibiotics that caused diarrhea.  He wouldn't let the caregivers clean his bottom and he sat in poop a lot all week.  Now he has a horrid rash and a rectal tear.  (That was ER visit #2.) We made the (tentative) decision to put him on hospice and they sent him back to the care home.  (Which is better than sitting in an ER hallway for 12 hours.  Ah, US healthcare, so great.)

Now he'll be back at the care home and again will likely not let them care for him.  I', m hoping the hospice nurses will have more luck.

But hell...is hospice the right decision?  He's 91.  Thinks he's 41.  If I told him 'we're not going to try to fix your legs/etc. anymore"" he'd be pissed because he thinks he's young and will get better.  But with the non compliance - it's just a constant game of whack a mole.  Also he's miserable - hates where he lives, is totally dependent on me and a paid caregiver (who thankfully he loves - she's the light in his life, the 2 days a week she comes).

For 76 year old mother who is beginning to show cognitive decline? ( no diagnosis) I want to be able to set her up at my computer and have her work independently. TIA,0
" 

I’ll start off by saying that I am aware and do how that anxiety and depression go hand in hand with cognitive decline and am in no way trying to accuse my mother of being dishonest. But I’m having a difficult time coming to terms with the fact that within 3 weeks, my mother went from having anxious tendencies to seemingly being completely dependent on Xanax to the point that she wakes me up constantly to take more and only thinks about these pills all day every day.

It’s been such a weird transition. And maybe it’s because I come from a background of working with and knowing people with addiction and mental health issues that I am so wary of benzos. But this descent into pill obsession with her has me very worried what the future looks like for her. She’s only mildly cognitively impaired as in she is forgetful more often but to be frank, her memory was always pretty bad. But now she spends her days zoned out on Xanax and is seemingly always wanting more. Even when she knows she’s taken her pill, she wants more and is counting down the minutes until she gets it. 

But what’s really throwing me off is that when I do give it to her, at the correct time, and explain that it will be 8 hours until she can have another, she will then say that she won’t take the pill until later when she “really needs it”, as if she wants to take multiple together or that the anxiety isn’t nearly as bad as she makes it seem in the moment. I try to explain that regardless of when she takes it, it will be another 8 hours until she gets more and she gets upset about it. In the past two days, she’s started saying that once she goes to assisted living ( this Friday) everything will be different and they will be “more clinical” with her medication…whatever that means. At first I tried to explain that medication will be no different at assisted living and that unlike right now, she won’t be able to bang on a bedroom door and demand pills whenever she feels like it. But I realized that even if she does understand that, it doesn’t matter because she thinks she will be able to get the meds more often regardless.

Since this has started, I’ve become very afraid of what is going to happen when she moves in. I’m trying to rationalize with myself that she’s just extra anxious because of the move and hopefully this will all settle down once she is there and gets comfortable. But the smarter part of me knows that this is only going to ramp up in intensity once she’s no longer in her own home. And being that she is becoming way more hostile and angry around this subject, I fear that I’m going to be getting a call about her not being the right fit for the facility and will need to be placed somewhere that deals with people who are exhibiting these kinds of behaviors. 

Any advice or reassurance from people who have dealt with something like this before? I’m kind of at a loss. Thanks in advance.",0

"My grandma with dementia is having progressively worse fecal incontinence, specifically diarrhea.  She wears grocery store pull-ups for it, but they just don’t contain the mess properly.  She goes into the bathroom and tries to clean herself up and ends up making a mess of everything.    


I really think she needs higher quality, more absorbent products, but everything that would be appropriate for her is a tape style diaper, which she can’t get on by herself.  We don’t have a 24/7 caregiver, so there wouldn’t be someone available to change her every time she needed it, plus getting the tapes off and back on again after using the bathroom normally would be impossible for her.

I haven’t used Facebook in 10 years, but about once a week I get a message from my friend (who is still on Facebook) with a screen shot of something weird my dad has posted to Facebook Stories.

Usually it’s something unintentionally hilarious and benign and my mom is able to delete it, if she catches it in time. 

Mom doesn’t want to take Facebook away from dad because he is able to stay connected with family and friends and he’s OBSESSED with it, but it also has caused trouble (him giving credit card info to scammers, him friending just ANYONE, posting bizarre things, somehow he once re-posted a family member’s new baby photos from fb to his own public profile, etc).

I am happy to be told that this is fine and normal, but it seems weird to me. We've swapped her days around during thanksgiving, christmas, New Years, MLK day,  and she never indicated that wasn't ok. I've worked plenty of jobs with hourly rates and day rates and I never got paid for time that I did not work. Should I just let her work on Monday and I can go somewhere else for the day? I definitely don't want her to quit, but I am curious if anyone else has seen this.",0
"Hi guys. First and foremost thank you for being here and for the empathy. I've been lurking a while and have read a lot which has  helped both me and my family.

My mother (late 70s) has gone downhill so fast over the past 12 months with alzheimers and another form of dementia. She's in specialist dementia care now from being independent this time last year. She doesn't form new memories at all any more and her mid to long term memory is degrading quickly. 

Some bad things are happening with her partner (who is not in care with her), to do with addictions and really awful behaviour. This happened after the memory loss started so she doesn't know that it has occurred or that it's impacting her family. I've tried telling her (gently) a couple of times, but all it does is really upset her, and she doesn't remember it the next time we talk. 

Her partner is now choosing to spend as little time as possible with her, after many years of them being together. So she is quite upset by that. Family visits from us are appreciated, but it's spent with her asking when her partner is going to move in or when she can move home with them. It's not feasible or safe for them to be at home together, and there is no chance the partner will self-admit to a dementia or even an aged care facility.

Can anyone give advice? Do we just accept we have to lie to her in order to spare her distress? I know we are doing the right thing by her, that she is safe and being cared for by competent people, but it is awful to see and hear her crying every day.",0
"Hello all, I used to post on r/caregiving when I was merely a caregiver for my father (92). We have now entered the world of vascular dementia. I am visiting doctors and lawyers as we continue on to placing him in care for his own safety and the safety of those around him while he becomes increasingly volatile.

My problem is his lady friend (82). She in no way wants him moved from his house. I am trying to be kind to her, but am at the point of ignoring her completely because it’s not her choice. He is a danger now to himself. She thinks she can “cure” him, make him see reason, and I certainly cannot persuade her of any other reality.

I need a little strength to remain kind to her. He will be moved. He will be angry, and so will she. I will be the bad guy here. 

When any of us are in this position, take a deep breath and know you are doing the best you can.

Thank you and have as nice a day as possible.",0
"I've had suicidal thoughts for years. So I finally went to a psychiatrist, and they prescribed some meds to help boost my serotonin levels and stop my racing thoughts.

While I'm going through all of this, my grandma's dementia is steadily progressing. She lives with us (my parents + brother). Even though there's 4 of us, really, only myself and my mom actually provide care for her. My brother helps on occasion. My dad does nothing because he's the one she chose to target, for whenever her belongings are rearranged or go missing. It's her that moves her own things around.

We're in the process of admitting her to a nursing home. Honestly it should have been done ages ago. I offered my mom some help multiple times to get the process started, but she turned me down every time. She waited until my depression worsened to the point where I could only manage one word sentences for a whole week and then she started. 

She started when I was incapable of helping...

I still have my doubts on her actually going through with it. I won't believe my mom's fake promises until they actually happen.

So as I kept taking my new meds, the suicidal thoughts begin to shift.

What if, my twisted head thinks, I just decide to kill my grandma instead?

She's already dead. What's left is just a husk that takes on her appearance. I have to fight these urges everyday. I've begun isolating myself when they get too strong. Normally it's my grandma's - the 'husk's' - angry outbursts that trigger them.

I keep feeling something bad is going to happen.

I'm going to break one day.

I can't continue much longer.

My sanity... It's paper thin right now. I want to rest. I want my grandma to rest. 

Each morning I hope that either one of us dies in our sleep. Ideally, both would be nice. It'd be so peaceful. And I can finally get away from my fucked up head...",0

"my grandma won’t be with us much longer, my family is here to say their goodbyes before she leaves this earth. I have extended cousins, nieces, nephews all coming. people she hasn’t seen or spoke to in years. she remembered them all. she responded to them all. she will grasp the hands of them all. my grandma helped raise me but she does not remember me, anytime I tried to speak to her she wouldn’t respond. I tried to hold her hand she pulled away. Her whole dementia journey she has not forgotten me once. Why is this happening now? is she going to remember me in the afterlife? I’m not sure I can sit with this for the rest of my life.",0
"Recently moved my father to memory care. He is adjusting alright, doesn't really want to be there. Desperately needed to be there.

Some local friends and non local extended family are causing a lot of issues. Basically, they only interact with him in small doses in recent years or only via the phone and do not understand the severity of his condition and demand he be removed from memory care. I have had several phone calls/arguments explaining his disease and his needs and also clearly stating it was my decision to make. To be clear, their opinions mean little to me because they are comically wrong / delusional about the overall situation.

What is the problem though is they are interfering with his care. One local friend showed up at the home creating a giant scene demanding to remove my dad and ultimately upsetting my dad. Others are frequently calling the facility demanding info / that he be allowed to leave. Also my dad will be fine then receive a call on his cell where they tell him he shouldn't be there etc, again setting him back and his adjustment.

I finally had enough. I took my dad's cell and gave the facility instructions he is no longer allowed to have any visitors except a particular list of people that are aligned on his care. I also said no updates to anyone on the phone and anyone calling to speak to him should be denied. It's my understanding some out of town relatives are planning a trip to come and remove him from the facility. I have instructions to the facility no one is allowed to take him out but me.

Curious for any feedback from anyone. On some level I feel bad I had to restrict access, at least for now. Also I am worried that despite my best efforts someone will get him out of the facility. It's a great facility, but not a prison. I am understanding they aren't specifically equipped to deal with situations like this.",0
"For the past four years, I have watched with compounding dread the progression of my father’s death. 

His brain is rotting away. Eventually, his heart will stop as a result of this glacial process of neurodegeneration - but for now it beats on, mechanically faithful and unaware of the inversion of purpose it has undertaken. It once sustained the life-force of an unshakably loving and faithful husband, father, grandfather (“Papa”). Now, it aimlessly drags out the agony of a victim, of a once proud man trapped in the jaws of a death roll between humanity and zombification.

Inversion is perhaps the most characteristic feature of this nightmare. Everything gets twisted. 

A son is not supposed to hope for the hastening of his father’s death, nor to watch the man who raised him from infancy to manhood become violently infantilized. A daughter is not supposed to see her father’s face aimed toward her like a weapon, torqued into a sneer, eyes hardened with suspicion for a stranger. A wife is not supposed to be trapped between the contradictory pulls of responsible medical decision-making and the vow, “til death do us part,” nor should she be haunted by pangs of regret for decades of love.

If my dad could see what’s left of himself now, he would beg for mercy. He would fall to his knees and petition his own Father to rescue him from proverbial Hell on Earth and bring him home to literal Heaven. *All will be made right in the light of Eternity.*

But I cannot shake the feeling that such a beautiful ending is meant for a story other than ours. In this version of the story, screams drown in the blind, furious winds of a cosmic storm. Mercy comes as dreamless sleep. 

In the end, then, I suppose mercy comes either way. And either way, I will miss him until I no longer have to.",0

As a caregiver, seeing dementia take over your loved one’s life can be overwhelming and exhausting. We understand that during the initial stages of post-diagnosis, the condition or circumstances you face may feel permanent. Along with the distressing symptoms experienced by your loved ones, you may also face several psychological, physical, and social issues. Post-diagnosis caregivers commonly struggle with sleep, stress, anger, frustration, resentment, and more. This leads to emotional and physical exhaustion. Unfortunately, these feelings make the caregiver go down a spiral of guilt and shame. However, it is normal to feel disappointed and grieve during this time. 

So what can you do to cope? 

One of the most important aspects of coming to terms with such a diagnosis is open communication. Social interactions with your loved one and other family members may change but encouraging the same despite the difficulties is key to creating a positive change. 

Here are a few additional things you can do to cope-

* Be kind to yourself throughout the process. 
* Reaffirm your identity
* Allow yourself to feel 
* Adapt your environment 
* Stay connected with family and friends
* Pursue your favorite hobbies
* Don’t be the sole caregiver",0

"I have sacrificed many years of my life to support my parents both unhealthy due to no fault of their own. My dad passed two years ago and I am now the full time caregiver of my mom. She was/is a great supportive mom but I can no longer care for her as she accuses me of controlling her medications and stealing from her etc. I am divorced with two kids under 10. They witness less than pleasant things and it’s time I put my kids first. It’s just a hard decision and I mean I’m crying even writing this but my mental health has significantly declined, I’ve put on 40lbs. I get ZERO outside help from any family/friends. I’m exhausted. I’m tired. I’m overwhelmed and depressed. My therapist gave me some numbers and I have delayed in calling them but it’s time. I have to throw in the towel. I regret that I am not superwoman and can’t take full time care of my incontinent, insulin dependent diabetic, cancer, arm amputee dementia ridden 78 yr old mother. She told me last week she would commit suicide if I put her in facility care. I have no choice. There is nothing more I can do. My slippers are covered in her shit. She wanders the house all night. She screams at me and verbally abused me with obscenities in front of my children. I left my ex for the same reason. I’m sorry Mom I let you down and I’m sorry dad I let you down when I said I would take care of mom. My sister lives far away and aside from demanding half the inheritance doesn’t give a fuck. I’m so angry and sad. I just want it all to go away. She forgets everything repeats everything can’t understand when I’m talking then blames me for it all. She has had several thousands of dollars stolen from her over the past year and she just recently quit a gambling addiction. If she hadn’t she would have been dead broke with me supporting her. Everyone of my family members has robbed her of the life insurance money my dad left her. I have been the only one caring for her, taking her to numerous sometimes 5x/week appointments multiple hospital stays and ER visits. I’m tired God, please help me.",0

"I have a grandfather with dementia, his judgement is questionable and he insists on driving despite having an invalid license and being a danger to everyone on the road, and the worst part is, HE KNOWS IT. 

He regularly breaks traffic laws, and In the past couple months alone I’ve been in more than a handful of near misses while in the passengers seat with him driving. 

Nobody seems to stop him from driving and he wants to get his license renewed, is there anything we can do to prevent him from doing that? Would a doctors notice bar him from getting It renewed, Or am I just going to have to start hiding the keys? 

I don’t want him to kill someone before realizing that he should not be driving.",0
"The caregiver (who is another family member) doesn't say things to the doctor that we suggest.  The reasons are 1) it was not important, 2) the doctor didn't ask about that specific scenario, 3) he didn't witness it, so he can't tell it to the doctor, and 4) he is trying to protect our family member.

When we try and talk to him about it he gets defensive and shuts down and will start arguing something completely unrelated, trying to make it out to be our problem.

I understand, this is very hard for him and it really affects him, but this is not the right way to handle it.  How do I talk to him?  How can I help him see this other point of view?

"In short, one of my relatives (over 80 years old) claims that a relative who has been dead for over 30 years has taken another dead relative(her spouse) who has been dead for 20 years from the grave and is holding her hostage.

I asked her if this can be only his imagination and he accepted that there is a chance that he could be wrong, but he knows for sure that what he claims is the truth. The person has not lost his coherence, you understand him, the only fact is that what he says is absurd; he lived alone for over 20 years.

I am trying to take him to a psychiatrist, but for the moment it is still difficult for me to convince her.

Until then, can you help me with some suggestions about what illness he may have and what are the chances of helping him.

Any advices regarding helping him are greatly welcomed.

"The past 3 weeks have been a whirlwind.  It seems like my dad has gotten a tad better the last week.  It could be that we've worked on his medicine and he's been consistent with taking it.

He will not let things go and obsess over things that need to happen.  I explain over and over again what's happening and after 2-3 minutes he brings it right back up.   He was frustrated yesterday over some financial and tax documents.  I told him my brother is dealing with that and after talking to my brother he still wasn't happy.   I told him that was not my area.  I'm assisting with other things and he needs to take it up with my brother if he has any issues.  

I have learned to let things go.  Some things which are happening are completely out of my control and I gotta move on to the next situation.   I am helping in the best way humanly possible right now and it's all I can do.  

We have home care during the day from 8 am-3 which helps a ton.   This is allowing me to still work and to get away to do things I need to do.   We are going to make some more improvements to his place and to make our lives easier and I will update then.

"Hi,

I hope this is okay to post. I'm a digital marketer, and I've just started volunteering for a charity that supports those dealing with dementia, both financially and through other support mechanisms (I won't mention the name now in case it seems like I'm trying to promote, that's not my intentions).

One of my main visions is to build out a 'blog' section on the website, filling it with content with the sole aim of trying to help those that feel the effects of dementia - predominantly family, or even a those who have it if the narrative suits.

Both of my grandparents have dementia, and as a result, I know how this takes its toll on those around them - I'll be kicking off with something like 'Tips on dealing with change' - something my family struggle with.

The purpose of this post is to ask whether anyone had any content ideas? What would you like to see? Any inspiration would be hugely appreciated, and it could go a long way in potentially helping others (the audience). FYI, the charity is UK based, and so is the audience - although if the content can provide universal help, that's all for the better.

I was looking for other communities like ours here, stumbled across AlzheimersGroup on here and it is a subreddit filled with hate, mocking and imitating people living with Alzheimers.

I help provide care for one of my family members with severe dementia. Lately, she has been spending a lot of time in her room just sitting on the edge of her bed doing… nothing?

"Is it just me, or does it seem like most of the resources and articles for families managing dementia are unrealistically positive or out of touch?  I know they have to walk a fine line between being too depressing or too upbeat, but sometimes it's very hard to relate.

Two things jump out at me.  The first is kinda silly on my part, but most of the images used are smiling, happy people hugging and behaving nicely.  Older couples strolling hand in hand. A daughter or nurse pushing a wheelchair. Big smiles all around. How about a little reality?

The second issue I have is that books and  articles seem to shy away from really exploring difficult relationships and offering solutions.  

What we get: ""keeping the spark alive when caring for your spouse"",   ""self-care for caregivers"", ""tools for communicating with your loved one"".  

I really don't mean to sound cynical, but I feel like we also need articles about ""caring for someone with Alzheimer's when the spark is gone"" or ""using forgiveness to improve your quality of life (and theirs) as a dementia caregiver"".   Or, ""having hard conversations when your family is estranged"" or ""how to get your family off their *sses and pitching in"". 

You probably get the idea.  I am actually very fortunate that things are almost going good for my family despite difficult relationships, 50 years of martial hurts and baggage, and assorted mental illnesses.  

But I so frequently see relationship issues in chat groups and message boards that I don't see acknowledged elsewhere.  I feel like, as hard as carrying for someone with dementia is, what makes it most painful for a lot of people is managing the past and working through years of bad behavior with little help and support from ""the system"" or extended family.  

Apologies for the rant.  It's something I've observed for a while.  I wonder if you've noticed it too.",0

"Hey fellow caregivers,

As someone who has been in your shoes, I understand the daily challenges of caring for a loved one with dementia. It's a full-time job that requires a lot of patience, love, and energy. But what happens when we reach our limits and just need a break? That's where respite care comes in.

I'm here to share my personal story and guide to finding respite care that can give you the break you deserve.

A few months back, I found myself at the end of my rope trying to care for my grandmother with dementia. We were at the park and she became disoriented and agitated, and I just couldn't calm her down. That's when a nurse approached us and suggested I reach out to a local respite care program. At first, I was hesitant, but after doing some research, I found a program that provided in-home respite care. And let me tell you, it was a game-changer.

The caretaker was experienced, compassionate, and knew exactly how to handle my grandmother's dementia. My grandmother was in good hands, and I finally got the break I needed. I was able to recharge my batteries and come back to caregiving with a positive outlook and renewed energy.

Here's my guide to finding respite care that can give you the break you deserve:

Reach out to your local Area Agency on Aging or Department of Health and Human Services for information on respite care programs in your area.

Ask for recommendations from friends, family members, and support groups.

Research online and read reviews of respite care programs to find the right fit for you and your loved one.

Consider in-home respite care, as it can provide a more comfortable and familiar environment for your loved one.

Don't be afraid to ask for help and take a break. Caring for yourself is just as important as caring for your loved one.

We're all in this together, and taking a break through respite care can make all the difference in the world. So go ahead, give yourself the gift of self-care and see the positive impact it can have on your caregiving journey",0
"Dementia can bring folks to think about things from a different angle. I share with you: 
They were thinking what to have for dinner, and thought out loud about having a peanut butter and jelly sandwich but asked that I would put on the peanut butter. 
I asked: do you want the bread toasted?
 [only have dark rye (pumpernickel)] 
They say: “well I don’t know how you’re gonna do that, it’s already brown.” 
I said “well I’d toast it in the toaster” 
They said “but it’s brown, how would that work?” 
I said “it would still work, that’s what the toaster does” 
(Chooses omelet instead.)",0
"Hello,

Does anyone know of a useful but relatively easy task that could be done by someone with neurological difficulties but in their better times can use a pocket calculator and do some mental arithmetic.

As I said something that would make the individual feel like they were achieving something, eg having a simple budget to track, or something of the like?

Thank you",0
"Today my (39F) mom (73F) sobbed hysterically on the phone to me — first because she hadn’t seen me in “so long” (I was with her for two weeks until this past Friday night, I live in NYC but spend 1-2 weeks per month with her in Georgia) then because she didn’t understand why she didn’t remember seeing me. Upon realizing this, she desperately begged me to take her to the doctor so they could “give (her) something to kill (her).” 

I haven’t heard her weep like that since my grandparents died. All day, her caregiver called and texted to tell me that mom was fluctuating between sobbing hysterically over having not seen me for years and walking to the front door to open it and call for me. When she tried to reassure mom, mom flew into a rage, striking her and calling her a liar, disbelieving that I’d just been there. Only a phone call with me would calm her before she’d forgot she had spoken to me and begin the cycle anew. We had 6 phone and FaceTime calls today alone.

Being her caregiver 1-2 weeks out of every month has shown me that my sanity, career,  marriage, and personal health cannot survive were I to live with her 24/7. But I don’t know how my heart is meant to survive this. 

The near-instinctive urge to set my entire life on fire just so that she never again experiences the pain of my being gone is almost overwhelming. But the stress when I’m in her presence, even with the assistance of other caregivers, is overwhelming, as I’m the target of her rage, pain, and confusion. I’m still covered in bruised from my two-hour battle  just to get her to shower for the first time in 10 days.

I don’t want to sedate my mom into oblivion, but I have no idea what to do. Moving her to NYC is not remotely an option, not practically and not financially.

She’s already on Cymbalta for depression and nerve pain from her multiple myeloma and osteoporotic spinal fractures (the physical pain is vastly better, as is her ability to speak, emote and follow TV shows and movies) but is there anything that might relieve this 24/7 fixation on me that begins within just a day or two of my leaving for NYC? 

Hospice wants her on Seroquel, but I’m worried about heavy sedation and memory care is refusing to take her until her violent attacks on caregivers end (they happen about 1-2x per week when I’m present, almost daily when I’m not). Are there any medications that might help with this without sedating her into oblivion?",0
"I’ve posted a number of times here, but I’m still in disbelief.  I don’t know what answer I expect to find, but I need to find out what happened.  Long story short - My out-of-state uncle who we hadn’t seen since Christmas 2019 due to the pandemic (but who spoke to the family regularly) wound up in a car accident, and after months in the hospital and then rehab, we were told “he can’t go home, he needs cues to dress and bathe himself” He’s 75, never married, no kids and lived by himself all his life.  His car accident was the last day of August 2022.  He bought a new car by himself in July 2022.  After he wound up in memory care, we talked to a few of his neighbors. Both had spoken to him within months of the accident and said he seemed fine.  One (who is also his accountant) said they had a long conversation about caring for plants and where to invest his money (in March).  The other one spoke to him in the winter and said he was fine.  The family spoke to him regularly via phone.  He seemed fine.  After we were told he couldn’t go home, my brother, mother and I went to his house, expecting it to be disgusting.  Other than well-organized (but overdue) piles of bills…the fridge had food, the house was immaculate and there were no smells nor even unwashed clothes. We know he didn’t have a housecleaner.  I read on this site that people with dementia can hide it, that accidents and anesthesia can make it worse.  How can someone hide the disease to the point of no one suspecting a thing?  The accident was him hitting a guardrail (apparently lost in a bordering state} Bad but not he only wound up with a wound to the leg.  When had anesthesia to operate. on his leg.  But why give any older person (or anyone) anesthesia if it does this to them??  The wound was bad,, but given the choice, I’d take my chances not operating on the wound rather than getting dementia.  And apparently he was cognizant enough to make his own decisions,, because our family was not contacted.  Fast forward we took him to a neurologist, who sent him to the hospital for tests.  He was initially diagnosed with encephalitis and we were told he had some white matter and brain shrinkage, but not more than other  older people.  They gave him IVIG with no improvement and the the neurologist was just like “” ok ,, no more tests needed, he has dementia.  I can’t live with myself if I don’t try to do everything I can to find out what happened.  Is it possible the hospital screwed up with the anesthesia?   Has anyone had a similar. situation where they had no idea there  was a problem and all of a sudden they are in the moderate stages of dementia?  My uncle. is the last person who would want to live like this (currently. In MC)) and I feel I owe it to him to find out what happened.  He was always a “young 75”. Always healthy.  Never in the hospital until this accident.",0
"So I’ve been mulling this question over in my mind……maybe I’m a little bit paranoid about my own cognition (as I’m getting older) since caring for 2 family members with dementia. But particularly since the pandemic began, when every day seemed to bleed into the next without a beginning or end, I’ve noticed the “day of the week” has really lost context for me (I’ll just check my phone “Oh crap- it’s Friday already!”). If I were an elderly person who didn’t get out and about regularly, and who was being evaluated for mental acuity, I can’t imagine I’d have a clue if asked (I imagine they’d not allow phone cheats).",0

"In 1896, the African island of Zanzibar was a British protectorate, which meant that the British had a great deal of influence over the island's affairs. However, when the Sultan of Zanzibar died, a power struggle emerged over who would become the new ruler. One man, Hamoud bin Mohammed, declared himself the Sultan and seized power.

The British were not happy with this situation and quickly took action. They sent a small flotilla of ships to Zanzibar, which arrived just 38 minutes later. The British troops quickly secured the palace and arrested Hamoud, declaring another man, Sultan Khalid, as the rightful ruler of the island. This military operation took only 38 minutes and became known as the ""British-Zanzibar Conflict.""

Although the conflict was brief, it had long-lasting effects. The people of Zanzibar saw Sultan Khalid as a puppet ruler, with the real power lying with the British. This caused resentment and mistrust of the British, leading to several uprisings and rebellions against their rule. Ultimately, Zanzibar gained its independence in 1963.

The British-Zanzibar Conflict showed the world the speed and efficiency with which the British could respond to a crisis. It demonstrated their power and dominance in the region and their willingness to use force to maintain control over their colonies and protectorate.",0

"This might sound awful, but my mother has dementia and I need to make some plans.

My husband is much older than me (he s fine) still working but really wants to retire and ideally move interstate. We moved to this state when our son was young, he got to know his grandparents which is good, my dad died 2 yrs ago at 98 (no dementia). Son is now a working adult.  
My mother had some bad memory issues while my dad was still alive but now full blown diagnosed dementia. Still at her home (even though she insists it's not hers and not happy there) refuses aged care.  


I have siblings also involved.  


How long do dementia patients live?   
I can't put my life on hold due to husband's age (and to be frank I want to move too) but would be so much easier if she was in care. I live closest so I am popping over most days and I am over it (yes I am horrible, there is more to this)",0
"Moved my parent to memory care today. The drop off was smooth because I didn't actually tell them what was happening. I worked with the staff on how to best handle this transition. Initial reports are that my parent is not doing well. Restless and trying to leave. They haved called me threatening to harm themselves. I've been in touch with the staff, they tell me this is not completely unheard of and they continue to reassure me that they know how to deal with it. I trust the staff and the facility I chose.

I had hoped for a different first day, but I'm not really surprised. My parent was adamant against moving and would not acknowledge anything was even wrong. This has to work because they cannot return home. That situation was no longer sustainable.

I don't really have a specific question. Anyone been here and how did it go?",0

We each have an opportunity to speak about how the last month has gone, and what new challenges we face.  We have empathy, and sometimes good advice, for each other.  The facilitator is a man who lost his wife to Alzheimer’s disease 5 years ago, so he knows the gut-wrenching times we are going through.

Once upon a time, there was a young man named Wei who lived in a small village near the Great Wall of China. Wei had always been fascinated by the Great Wall and had heard many stories about its grandeur and its ability to be seen from space.

One day, Wei decided that he would become an astronaut so that he could see the Great Wall with his own eyes from space. He worked hard and studied hard, and after many years of effort, he finally achieved his dream. He was selected to go on a mission to space to explore the universe.

As Wei soared through space, he was amazed by the beauty of the earth below him. He could see the vast deserts, lush forests, and sparkling oceans. However, as he gazed out towards the Great Wall, he was disappointed to see that he could not see it from space with the naked eye, contrary to popular belief.

Wei was puzzled. He had heard that the Great Wall was one of the Seven Wonders of the World and was so massive that it could be seen from space. He decided to investigate and learn more about the Great Wall and why it was not visible from space.

Wei returned to earth and began to talk to experts and scholars about the Great Wall. He learned that the Great Wall was indeed massive, stretching over 13,000 miles, but it was also narrow and not very tall. The walls and towers were made of brick and stone, which blended into the surrounding landscape, making it difficult to see from space.

Wei also discovered that the myth of the Great Wall being visible from space was started by a misunderstanding of a comment made by a famous astronaut. The astronaut had said that the Great Wall was visible from low Earth orbit, but people had misunderstood and thought it could be seen from space.

Wei was now more knowledgeable about the Great Wall, but he still felt a sense of disappointment. He decided to visit the Great Wall and see it for himself. He traveled to different parts of the Great Wall and was amazed by its beauty and grandeur. He marveled at the skill and dedication of the workers who had built the wall over many centuries.

As Wei walked along the Great Wall, he realized that the true beauty of the Great Wall was not its visibility from space, but its history, culture, and the people who had built it. The Great Wall was a symbol of strength, perseverance, and the human spirit.

From that day on, Wei was proud of the Great Wall and told everyone he met about its true beauty and importance. He spread the word that the Great Wall of China was not visible from space with the naked eye, but it was still a magnificent and important part of human history.

And so, Wei's journey of discovery about the Great Wall of China ended, but his love for the Great Wall and his passion for spreading the truth about it lived on.",0

John has started Sundowning, and something that Charlene and Bill are finding particularly difficult is that he's up and down through the wee hours of the night.  It keeps them awake as he gets up and down and wanders around, and then, when he finally settles back down around 4:00 or 5:00AM, they're wide awake.

"Idek where to start. It's been a horrendous start to 2023. 
I guess I should start by saying my Grandad suffered a stroke and a heart attack at the same time in June 2022. Since then he's been in states of delirium, confusion, rage, and who knows what else. The hospital did a dodgey discharge, the package of care completely inadequate. I got social workers and occupational therapists round to get help for my nan in caring for my grandad but he locked them all out and wouldn't let my nan out to them either. So for 7 months she's just been forced to do everything. 

My nan has COPD and a heart condition. On 10th Jan she couldn't breathe. Grandad just sat and watched her nearly stop breathing. She managed to call her own ambulance and crawl to the door to let them in. She's 76. He only interacted with the situation to yell at the paramedics that he doesn't like the hospital they were taking my nan to. My Grandad deeply loved my Nanna. They have been together nearly 60 years. The amount of mental disconnect I can see just in this situation alone is heartbreaking. 

It has come to light since returning home in August 2022, my Grandad had been abusing my Nanna. She's the sweetest and most pure soul in the entire world and she was just going to live her days out like that because he wouldn't let us get any help in for them. For context I am the only non disabled member of my family, I am in the army so am nowhere near home to be able to do anything other than manage their bills for them, as well as liaise with the social services, GP, community mental health, etc, etc. I do as much as possible for them. 

My Nanna has decided she cannot return home as looking after him solely has nearly unalived her. We are obviously really happy she is making a fresh start and going to live for herself now and get better. We are overjoyed she won't be subjected to the things she told me (horribly, some of her attacks at the hands of my grandad have been of a s3xual nature). But I'm struggling so badly with it all. My Grandad was always such a gentleman. He would be absolutely horrified if he knew the things he'd done to my Nanna. The remains of him doesn't understand why my Nanna is leaving and it's ripping me apart. These people raised me for the first 6 years of my life, we are close. The rest of the family joke and tell me I'm the apple of their eye. I'm now Grandad's NOK. I'm working so hard to do right by the both of them. 

Due to my Grandad attacking my mum who was trying to help him on 19th Jan I'm the only one left who is allowed or safe to contact him - so am very much being put in the middle of their marriage breakdown. My Nanna has been deemed a medium risk by the domestic ab-use unit and my mum has been told she is likely to be ""under threat"" if alone in my grandad presence. She also has MS herself so you even blow in her direction she will fall over. 

Sorry this has been a huge vent, if you're still here thanks for reading. I'm feeling so happy for my nan yet torn and lost for grandad. And absolutely useless because I can't be there.",0

My mother basically wakes up, has a tv on but cant retain anything, most of her talk is agreeing with people and not making sense when she does tell a story.

I hate seeing her suffer, she lived alone at home where her friend just came over and they would eat and doing little home projects but in the last 2 years she has just been falling apart and aimlessly poking around her house.

I just had to sign papers for comfort level care. Her father died from a long battle with dementia, and she has always been massively independent.

Most of the memory care facilities are from 4-5 thousand a month so what other options is there for lower income people with dementia?

"Recently, my mother (86, Lewy Body)  has had some sort of weekly medical complaint that she considers a crisis situation. Very often whatever symptoms there are, they subside in a couple of hours. Case in point, this morning she is saying she has lower left abdominal pain. I asked if she had a fever (she didn’t respond) or perhaps she just needs to use the bathroom (she said yes, has gone 3xs). She is in assisted-living so they’re going to assess her to see if further care is needed. 

My concern is what can I do when I just have a day where I cannot get away from the workflow? 

Has anyone tried using an elder care service (like Visiting Angles) in taking their loved one to the doctor including  having them sit with the person in the doctor’s office. This would be a must because the person with dementia won’t retain information. And will a service such as this take on a last-minute request for help?

Thanks!

"How long between diagnosis and needing a nursing home, for your loved ones?",0
"Ive worked in health care for a few years now and these are some tips for those who have relatives going into care homes/nursing homes. This is directed mainly at dementia and old age care. Just some things I personally would find useful if someone told me. Hope it helps. 

Clothes and Items – 

⚪️ Provide plenty of clothes for your relatives stay – ( Even if your relative is only staying for two nights 2x pairs of underwear a t-shirt and trousers are not sufficient as they may need changing throughout the day/night) 

⚪️ Appropriate clothing – clothes that are easier to put on for the relative - although we will always assist where needed and asked, the resident may want to keep some independence – no buttons or zips if they have trouble with these, elasticated waist, stretchy clothing, appropriate nightwear - clothes that are big enough, or if the relative has lost weight the appropriate size. (These do not have to be just joggers and t-shirts as there is now a wide range of different clothing to suit all styles and abilities. They also do not have to be expencive)

⚪️ Provide appropriate footwear for your relative (see pictured example). Take into account - mobility, do the shoes fit properly? Are they able to put on the shoes without assistance? (Velcro or slip ons may assist them with this) foot swelling, Non slip shoes with grip at the bottom to avoid falls. 

⚪️ Please do not send valuable items, cash, credit/debit cards, IDS - anything that would be missed if lost. 

Inventory list – 

⚪️ Write a detailed inventory list of things sent into the home to avoid loss of items. (It may seem silly to be so detailed, but even with proper labelling items can be lost) 

⚪️ Keep a copy for yourself and supply a copy to the home for their records. 

Example – 
Jane Smith Inventory List – 30.02.2033 
1 x gold wedding band with inscription “love john”. 
2x black m&s brand short sleeved t-shirt. 
1x pair of black slippers with red butterfly embroidered on the heel part of the shoe. 
1 x red Zimmer frame. 

Labelling Items – 

When it comes to possessions, labelling is important so you don’t lose your relatives things, staff will not always recognise unique items, and items can often be lost. 

⚪️ Label all items that go into the home – All clothing, socks, underwear, dressing gowns, slippers,  shoes, blankets, pillows, teddies etc. 

⚪️ Use full names on labels, middle names if the persons name is very common. (Room number is not always best as they could be moved to a different room or a different home.)

⚪️ Iron on names are very useful ( see example)  easier and cheap to do. If purchased, the homes will most times help you with applying the labels to the possessions (ask if possible first). 

Card and photographs etc – 

⚪️When it comes to birthday cards writing “gran” inside the card is fine, but you may want to add who the card is for on the back of it (full name) – so the staff can keep the cards with the right resident as we may not always know who it belongs too. (Envelopes often get thrown out especially if the card is displayed) 

⚪️ Write on the back of photographs who’s in the photo graph and what year if known the picture was taken. Also the name of your relative as it helps staff keep items safe. 

⚪️Photo frames – plastic photo frames with no glass are best to avoid breaking the item and possibly injury- be sure to label both the picture and the frame.  

⚪️ If sending a photo album please  the resident write full name on each photograph on back and also inside the photo album – as just “nannas photo album” does not help staff keep items with the appropriate owner. 

⚪️ Pictures of the residents home, garden, pets, favourite places are excellent as it helps promote memories and might provide a familiar comfort to them.

⚪️ Copies of certificates of accomplishments or Pictures of feats or accomplishments are also good for the above reasons.

⚪️ Large print calendars on walls /white board  - Writing for example “today is Monday 30th of January” or “ your son James visiting tomorrow after lunch” – it can help provide stability and comfort to the resident. 

Continence aid -

⚪️ If you provide continence aid (aka pads) for relative please make sure you supply enough & the appropriate kind (needs change over the years and your relative may need something different than what they had at the start of their stay – staff would be happy to point you in the right direction of what and suggestions of best places to buy it). 

⚪️ Please don't use terms like ""nappies"" with your relative it's rude and could upset them. 
 
Treats and favourite foods - 

⚪️ It’s always best to label these so they don’t get lost or confused with another residents item. Write on the back with sharpie the initials or name of the relative.

⚪️ Be careful of dietary or health needs regarding food – of course we would never want to restrict your relative from their favourite foods, but please be wary of their needs – especially when it comes to diabetics. (Informing staff of treats provided may help staff monitor and understand blood sugar levels – “Hey I gave “Jane” some jelly babies and 2 glasses of wine just to let you know incase her blood sugars are high”.

Remember that those with dementia, cognitive impairment, or just those who are getting older – their needs will change, sometimes very quickly. Hope these tips help. Share away. - JP",0
"Hello. I've been finding this sub so helpful in terms of feeling not alone and reading all the advice shared. I wonder if anyone has had to deal with violent screaming from their LOWD? 

We (me f43 + my saint of a partner m49+ daughter almost 2) moved my mother (f77) in with us in November after an emergency situation which had her in hospital and then care while we sold her house and ours and bought a place further out of town we could all live in together. She was given a 7 year life expectancy last year, but she's not too far gone yet, she can't follow discussion and her memory is bad, she mixes up relationships and people, but she's still got capacity most of the time. 

I think every time we visited mum we got her on her best behaviour, just the occasional snappiness. We were not prepared for the mood swings and aggression we now see on a daily basis. The first two days were a dream and it was beautiful watching grandmother and granddaughter playing and reading together, and that was the main reason for doing this, as well as helping the savings last longer to give her better quality care for as long as possible but also if she has 1-3 years of being able to be present and know what's going on, to be with family, to feel loved, and to get joy from her granddaughter, who she does love in a way she never displayed for me, she wasn't very maternal, she was quite strict but she was a dutiful mother. Its been lovely to see her joke and laugh with my daughter, so nice to see that softer side exists. 

In a way I wish we hadn't had and don't have the good days because it makes me feel like she can behave if she tries. 

Today, she only wanted soup, soup was made as soon as requested, and at her usual supper time, took 2 minutes, told ""you just need to wait a minute for it to cool down as it's a bit hot"", and she just screamed at the top of her voice in frustration. Right next to me, staring at my face, spitting a bit as she screamed. She does this whenever she bumps into anything, she's a little unsteady, but even if it's not a bump that would hurt, she screams at the top of her lungs, it's like living with a shrieking banshee.. And if she can't do what she wants she just stands there and screams, or sometimes she will swear at us and call us names. Occasionally, very occasionally, she lashes out physically and hits us, but I also recognise she does that if one of us reprimands her or corrects her and we are both  trying hard to think in her non-logic way and not correct her, but is taking some getting used to to respond differently to how you would a normal person. 

Really I feel we are bending over backwards not to say no too much, and to do what she wants, for example, we are locking the front and back door all the time because she's anxious about foxes getting in (we see a fox about once a fortnight and never in the garden, just on the neighbours shed). We do have to share the family space though and I don't want it so mum rules the floor, and we have to hide upstairs, so if my daughter is watching something we ask mum to watch in her room if she wants to watch something different. 4/10 times she will watch with her granddaughter, 4/10 times she will go to her room, potentially being rude about it on the way, 2/10 times she will just scream, until she has to draw breathe. 

The demanding, the moodiness and rudeness, I can brush off no problem, though it is not the environment I would wish for, certainly not to raise my daughter in. The screaming goes right through you, through the whole house, it's nails on a blackboard. I worry what on earth it is doing for my daughter as it must be frightening for her.  I'm starting to feel like I'm on edge all day waiting for the scream... 

Has anyone else had to deal with this?

And two minutes after she's flipped she acts fine again while we are all reeling from it. I don't think she knows or recalls she is doing it as much as she is.",0
"We all know how horrible dementia can be,so I was wondering (only if you feel comfortable) people would share the good times to make this page a bit happier even if it’s just a few minutes.

For me the best memories were convincing my nan take me to the chip shop when I stayed over as she couldn’t cook and then it turning into the best days",0
"I toured two memory care facilities yesterday for my dad (lewy body dementia diagnosis) and I liked both of them for different reasons. I'd love to hear from those of you with loved ones in memory care what stuff is more or less important once the person is actually in the facility & what makes their and your life easier. Location and cost are similar for both and all of the staff seemed engaged & appropriately trained for dementia patients. My dad is pretty social so I am not concerned about him staying in his room in either option.

Facility A: large ""continuum of care"" campus. Lots of interesting-sounding programs & activities because there are many independent and assisted living residents. Memory care residents can join those activities too. Extensive grounds with lovely walking trails, swimming pool, cafe and ice cream stand so there would be lots to do when my sister visits with her energetic 2 year old (and I think they would stay longer/come more often). The Memory Care building has 40 residents. The place is perfectly fine looking. Rooms are tiny- can just fit a bed & dresser. There is an onsite health clinic with doctors where my dad could receive his primary care, which means I would have one less thing to manage for him. Campus includes a nursing home where my dad could move once he needed skilled care. 

Facility B: Only a memory care facility, divided up into ""neighborhoods"" of 16 residents based on personality/interests/ability level. Facility is more attractive looking and the rooms are bigger - can fit a bed & sitting area, so we could hang out in my dad's room when visiting. I was shown one of the neighborhoods based on how I described my dad and the residents seemed like people I could picture him with & I liked the cozier feel. Plenty of activities, but they are more dementia-specific. There is a nurse on duty. Small outdoor area and fewer things to do if my sister & her son visited, so I don't think she could stay as long.

UPDATE: Thank you all for your input. based on some of the responses, I wanted to note that my dad is super social so I am not concerned about him spending too much time in his room. Also, I am not trying to bribe my sibling with amenities! She is a single parent moving across the country so her 2yo can spend more time with his grandparent and I am just trying to make it easier for her to be there.",0
"I could never explain how it feels to watch you fade, you were always the health one of us all, you had no problems. Ever. Watching you slowly disappear and know that this problem of yours is the only one I cant fix ruins my heart and soul. You were a beacon I could never learn everything from in my whole life. Why do you remember me more than my cousins and brother? Why am I so important? 

I dont want you to go. Please dont go. 

I love you. It will be ok.

Love you,",0
"Vent ahead: Does anyone else ever just get so angry? Not at their loved one, but just at the whole situation. 

My dad and I moved my mom to memory care in October, and she’s been on a downward spiral ever since - we don’t think she has long now. Thinking about the situation makes me feel so sad, and so depressed, but also just infuriates me. When I see pictures of my acquaintances and their moms smiling, spending time together, I keep thinking, “I’ll never have that again.” It makes me so mad, so ragingly envious, I could honestly just scream until I start sobbing. 

Anyone else ever feel the same?",0
"I’m home visiting my mom and dad. Dad has dementia. He’s progressing pretty swiftly.

This morning my dad pulled me aside and told me he needs help and needs to get out of here because my mom is hitting him.

However, my mom does have a past of being a bit physical with me and my brother, so I would believe it, but again, he’s so far progressed. 

I genuinely don’t know what to do or think, but im rattled. 

Some advice please.",0
"Hi all. I’m 21 years old and I’m admitted to the cardiology floor at the hospital due to some of my health issues. I have a roommate who has dementia and let’s just say it’s been a little difficult. I’m a nursing student so I’ve worked with dementia patients before but being the patient is a little different. I have gotten 2 hours of sleep max a night because she won’t stop yelling. She has even tried to get up and come to my bed a few times. She yells at me sometimes for being on the phone with a friend (I try to stay quiet) or my mom coming to visit. And sometimes she’s just mean. I feel so sad for her and I’m not mad at her for any of this at all because I know it’s out of her control. But at this point I’m getting really irritable because I’m running on no sleep and I feel like I’m walking on eggshells. Switching rooms isn’t an option. So I’m wondering if anyone has any advice. Thank you.

Edit: she was just freaking out about the mirror so I just taped paper towels over it and it seems to be helping some. This may be able to buy me some quiet time. I feel so helpless, I can’t even imagine how she feels and what this is like for her.",0

"My apologies if this doesn’t seem appropriate for this sub but it felt relevant to me. The first episode of this series hit me pretty hard as a sole caregiver of someone with dementia. 

From the condition of Ptolemys  home, the way he reacts when someone attempts to tidy up, all the way to how nonchalant he is about not having working plumbing,
Samuel L. Jackson does an outstanding job of portraying the struggle of someone with dementia. 

You can tell the writers really did their homework when it comes to telling the story from the perspective of Alzheimer’s/dementia. 

Anyways, I thought it was an excellent production from start to finish, very gritty yet heartwarming and it touches on everything from the struggles of caregivers to the family dynamics and beyond. I think you’ll need an Apple TV subscription to watch it but if you can please Check it out, it’s only 6 episodes.",0
"The little man I care for is in a high stage of anxiety (severe vascular dementia). I'm waiting for the family to decide what they are doing (home health or hospice).

"This morning, I went to pick up my grandmother for an appt, and one of the CNA's warned me that she had very challenging all morning (I hear this often). She was on her 6th day wearing the same filthy clothes, had refused her scheduled shower (they're biweekly and this was the 7th in a row that she skipped), and I could smell her full depends. She was adamant that she was not going to change anything. 

I was able to convince her to change clothes, but she doubled down on her refusal to change her depends. She's been more aggressive in situations like this, the past couple months, as she's realized that the CNA's will eventually back down, and it makes her angry that I will not. Today, she started saying, ""I am the adult. You are the child. I do not do anything that you say, so get out!"" She tried to barge out of the bathroom without any pants, so I would hug her, rubbing her back and telling her I love her, while holding her in place. I didn't know how to respond to that comment, though. I felt guilty. I had been very kind about it and understand her frustration over feel the loss of control, but if she had her way she'd never change or shower or brush her teeth.

She eventually decided that I was right, changed, and was in a great mood after that! Just wondering how any of you respond to comments regarding seniority and autonomy?",0

"Besides grandparents, you don't experience old age until your parents get there in most senarios, so hard to know what is normal.

She can never remember whether I was in a conversation ""were you there when I said that?"" Always losing things. Sometimes she has strops, her behaviour changes. It may be nothing but its been enough for me to question it. 

I must note she had a fall 2 years ago, resulting in a fracture at the back of her skull amongst other injuries, just on the curved bit before it comes down the neck, so don't know if this would contribute to any memory loss. 

Her Uncle died of Dementia so its in the family.",0

"Hello,  

We are students in MA innovation design management,  we are making a survey about the concerns of people who are taking care of family members or friends with mental illnesses that affect the behavior of a person such as Alzheimer's or Dementia.   


The product that we are designing for this problem is a mesh network of devices within the home environment which would only ping upon movement of the non-intrusive Bluetooth sticker when moved beyond the boundaries.  Upon exiting the mesh an alarm is sent in the app and the tracker turns into a GPS device which emits its location out into the registered devices of caretakers.

"My grandma was previously in assisted living for about a month before we HAD to find her another place to stay (they often forgot to bring her meals even though she was on the room service list, changes to meds without notifying the family, 1 shower the whole time she was there, and on and on). It’s so frustrating trying to find a good home for her. Everywhere is understaffed and under paying the caretakers. This is absolutely NOT a drag to caretakers, but it is a drag to the large corporations that mistreat their staff by overwhelming them with patients while providing an insulting pay rate. 
This whole experience has just been depressing. It’s sad to see how we treat our elderly in the US. I pray this new place we have picked out will be able to give her the care she so desperately needs. She will now be entering memory care as she needs a large amount of supervision.",0

When you think of dementia, memory loss would be a common symptom that comes to mind. However, there is a lot more to the condition. The general stigma surrounding memory loss can push people away from a clinical diagnosis. Based on the severity of the condition, it is important to understand when to lie and when to be honest. For severe circumstances, lying may aggravate the condition. However, for cases that have been recently diagnosed, lying can distort reality and be an obstacle to treatment. 

Here are a few therapeutic approaches that can help you cope with the same-

* **Therapeutic fibbing**\- Involves turning the truth to fit the reality of the individual diagnosed with dementia. It can help reduce emotional distress and stop troubling behavior.
* **Validation**\- being completely present, affirming, and compassionate toward the individual's feelings, emotions, and thoughts. 

Most importantly remember that there is no one size fits all approach to caregiving. Hence here are a **few things to consider while you respond to someone with dementia**.

* Avoid environmental lies
* Take a flexible, empathetic, and tailored approach while telling the truth. 
* Take time out to evaluate the meaning of reality for the loved one.",0
"EDIT: Solved. They are going for two types of locks on one door, intertwined, so that they can use the lock they understand in the moment. Then if they get worse, the app to open the smart lock can be erased from their mobile etc. They are still fairly functional adults.

"I'm trying to decide if we have my mom evaluated by another neurologist. Our first wasn't interested in nailing down the type. He diagnosed her with mild cognitive impairment and prescribed her two ""memory drugs"" which seemed to cause her first-ever wandering episode. That wandering from assisted living immediately landed her in memory care (we were given 24 hours notice to move her).   
His logic was that you can't really tell and that it's best to prescribe the meds and then see how she responds. However, she couldn't reliably report on the side effects. The staff didn't know her well enough to report on it. And while we noticed that she seemed spacier and had trouble finishing her sentences, we didn't see here every hour of every day to have a full grasp of the impact.   


Is this your experience with neurologists or did we get one who was burnt out? There was also no mention of genetic counseling...etc for anyone in the family.",0

I’ve always had depression since a young age it’s just worse now, it’s been three years with my moms condition she’s not the same ofc, she yells rather than talks and it’s just a problem to deal with everyday. I feel horrible seeing how depressed my dad is, my siblings having mental breakdowns bc they have to deal with her and take care of her, I have two sisters and two brothers all 22+ and it seems only my sister take care of her and I feel bad that they have to come back from work/college to take care of her. My brothers say they will help with her but never do, my dad has been doing everything for her for the past few weeks and is just too sick tired and sad to keep on going. I feel horrible with the way I treat them my dad always try’s to seem so happy and just coddle her. What’s worse is he thinks she will get better… I just cry every night, with my earphones in, I always think I hear her calling my name, it seems not a long time ago she was waking me up for elementary getting me ready. I hate coming back from school bc I used to always open the door to her cooking and greeting me. My dad now (he’s 61) does everything she used to do and it’s not the same.

He even puts it on the table and I'll tell him what was that? He can't give me an answer as to what he thinks he sees so I just pretend to throw it away for him and ignore it most of the time.

My question is this, has anyone experienced the same situation. How did you get your person to where they needed to be. We feel like our hands are tied, and we refuse to sacrifice what's left of our own lives taking care of his abusive mother. What options do we have.

My dad is a MD, but he even seems like he’s at a loss of what to do and just works a lot. 

Now my mom does have friends and family, but she has basically constructed conspiracies about how they are evil, Russian assets, fake friends, etc, but trying to convince her out of it is impossible. 

I basically have the same conversation every day, not that she remembers, which basically is talking endlessly about her trying to kill herself and how she has nothing left live for.

Happy New Year.

First post here but have been reading first the last few months since my MIL was officially diagnosed.

Has anyone signed up for the IHSS California program? If so has it worked out for you?

She’s still able to hold a conversation and go to the restroom on her own and all that but she requires 24 hour supervision.

My mother is definitely in stage 5 or stage 6 of dementia. but that is my speculation.  Does she need to take Mini Mental State Exam for a neurologist to validate her state of Dementia ? Seek opinion from others how to qualify a person into a memory care center.,0
"My father has been living with my family for almost 3 years.  (Insert all the usual details of progression here).  He’s almost ready for memory care. Still says he doesn’t want to go, but he’s close to ready. When I moved him in, I also moved my mom to a skilled nursing facility around the corner.  I’ve been juggling taking care of them for at least 5 or 6 years, it’s really hard to say when it went from just stopping by (an hour from my house) and being a nosy son once a week to actually paying the bills, taking out trash, shopping, etc.  I was there every day and had an aide when I finally moved him in. It actually made my life easier for a while.     
My situation is this. I have two sisters that have been ZERO help. One is a piece of shit and is waiting for her cut, the other is just too successful to slow down and help for a second. 
So fast forward to today.  I’m in the nursing home at my mothers bedside and she’s got days, if that.  
I think I just guilt tripped the successful one into taking Dad to a facility that’s basically across the street from her house. If I pull the trigger he’ll be 3 hours away.  
So my question, for those of you that have experience.   Should I do it?
  Just go cold turkey?  I really want my
life back (great wife that needs a break and kids in 5th and 8th that are so damn awesome) but I fell like I’ve been doing this for so long I’ll go crazy when I give up control and don’t even get to see him.   At the same time, I’m done and starting to resent him.    So…. Memory care here and just see this mess to its conclusion, or go cold turkey and let him go?",0

"I'm 17 years old, yet over the past 3 years I swear my memory has been getting much worse.  

I'm forgetting to do certain chores and other things, like taking my meds.

My grammar is somewhat still good, but sentences just feel really hard to write.  Sometimes I forget the meanings of certain words that I swear I knew the meaning to before.  Maybe that's just because they're big words, though?  My spelling is also horrible, sometimes.

I remember hearing that earwax buildup can cause dementia, and I wear earplugs constantly, so maybe that's an explanation?

Looking at my older drawings, I notice that they're pretty good.  Not beautiful, but just good.  I've become more impatient with art, however, and I swear that my art has gotten worse.  Idk, though, maybe I'm just being too critical.  I don't draw often, either.

I don't know if this is dementia or if it's because of something else.  I'm autistic and I have ADHD, and my sleep schedule isn't that great.

"Hi everyone, it's been awhile but I'm back.

Well after a month in the hospital, and me denying her home, they found her a place. I only visited once a week while she was there and really stuck to the plan. They said the hospital would cover the costs minus her monthly SSI for three months. Social worker called from her personal phone and told me to just agree and if they hadn't found her a permanent place by the end of the three months and I still refuse, they'll send her back to the hospital and start the process again.

I've been in therapy and actually feeling better but that guilt does me in smh although I'm bringing up a lot of things from my childhood and just life in general, cutting the ties have been hard to accept.

They moved her last week. Saturday I get a call for some of her otc meds. Sunday morning I take them and the director says I'll need to come back and sign papers and to make sure I bring two checks, one for the remainder of this month and for January. I explain that my mom doesn't have an account, her money's deposited to a card. She basically blows me off and says oh well bring your checks. She tells me mom needs clothes. I try explaining mom has used her clothes to wipe herself or just in them so she doesn't have many. Her response, buy some. Oh and she needs Tylenol, cough syrup and Imodium. I go and get the Tylenol and Imodium and take that. She again reminds me about the checks. I say well let me contact social security because I'm not really comfortable using my account for this, I'm truly not trying to be involved. She quickly tells me they won't send it directly to them and it takes too long to deal with them. I just left.

My therapist, husband and daughter have all told me to let go. They've told me to stop answering my phone. They've reminded me how if the situation was reversed, my mom would truly only worry about herself. My daughter specifically said there's no way granny would do all this for you especially after peeing on her floor. She said she wouldn't be speaking to me if I did it and the baby wouldn't get a pass. They all remind me I have to do this for my son who doesn't deserve to live with the anger and a depressed, stressed mom. 

But the guilt. Has me sitting here trying to figure out how to just walk away. How do I not answer the calls? How will I know if it's a regular call and THE call? 

I just keep reminding myself that I have done all I can for her and this is the way. My husband deserves a sane and healthy wife. My kids deserve a present mother. And my new grandbaby deserves all the attention and love. I'm sure this isn't the end. My daughter says my mom's too evil to pass on so she has at least seven years. Why seven I don't know lol I'm sure she just wanted to make me smile. I'm doing more of that now. I still have my bathroom breakdowns but each day it gets a little easier.

"My mom won’t stop using the gas stove to boil water for tea and she just leaves the room to go back to watching TV, resulting in the water drying out. My mom drinks 18 fl oz’s of tea 3-4 times a day and I recently bought her a glass electric kettle to boil water so this issue no longer happens. I know glass is dangerous but she won’t drink from a metal kettle but yet will gladly drink from a tiny metal saucepan. The kettle is within an arms distance but I think it gets a bit heavy to hold when there’s water in it. She has issues with her right arm from falling on ice earlier this year. 

I am desperate to find a solution because the replacement resource is there but my mom consistently says that she won’t use the electric kettle because electricity costs more than gas. We are financially in a decent place. I’ve told her psychiatrist about this, in an attempt to maybe get an authority figure involved bc she seems to listen to doctors but it’s not working. My mom uses a small saucepan to boil water and I’ve tried to take it away but she just used a larger pot. 

I just finished washing my hair and I see that my mom is scrubbing the infamous saucepan that she boils water in and it’s scorched. I asked her what happened and she said the water boiled out and now the tiny saucepan is stained. I am desperate for this to end because we live in an apartment on the first floor. I don’t want to place other people in danger but I can’t really think of an adequate solution other than removing the stove at this point. I also live here so that’s not really a solution.",0

"I'm the calmest most capable person in my family. Even before it would be considered age appropriate, I was everyone's side kick and therapist. My immigrant parents caught on and had me help everyone though I was the youngest. My mom was fully burnt out by the time I was born so she wasn't the great parent to me that everyone else experienced. She was aggressive and violent toward the end, worse than the trope of old ladies in horror films. I took care of her till she died at great personal cost. My dad on the other hand had a reversal he was a mild mannered doctor with mandarin sized tumor pressing on his brain giving him emotionally induced non epileptic seizures. Not damaging to him but he'd get crazy/angry and not form memories of the event. In retrospect everyone but me triggered them until I triggered the the largest one where he could snap out of it. He hit me several times with a pipe before I got it away from him, broke everything in sight except a truly ugly ceramic Christmas tree and broke my thumb with a hammer. I didn't hurt him in the process. Surgery, rehab and therapist. I dealt with them both simultaneously. No point in getting mad because there was too much to do and no other sibling could help. I took out loans to care for them while my siblings couldn't agree on how to ensure my dad didn't send all their money to scams. So now my dad is in a good place, codependent with his cat who he spoils rotten. I remind them both they shouldn't forget who feeds them and they giggle together. 'We would never forget you' anyway, it's mostly good. He has occasional dementia episodes where he is difficult. In proportion to everything that came before it's nothing...but I'm disproportionally angry and every other feeling like return of the repressed. I know if he takes a nap he'll snap out of it but sometimes I want to force him to understand when he's still in the altered state which is irrational. I'm trying not to be burned out. I'm addressing my own neglected health. I'm productive,active and I'm finding ways to decompress. I seem fine then some mornings I throw up stomach acid,just an example, I am working on it. My point is now things are better it's hitting me. I'm used to crisis and now the times I'm most functional is when I get angry then channel it afterwards. The rest of the time is incremental progress, sedate but steady.

It’s not fair. She survived the Great Depression. She ran away from home to be a Rosie the Riveter. She escaped an abusive marriage. She helped run a 15,000 acre ranch. She was a legal secretary. She traveled the world. And now she knows maybe 10% of that information. 

I miss her. I miss cooking with her. I miss not making the bed correctly and her redoing it when she thought I wasn’t looking. I miss her stupid song I hated when she would sing to my kids.

I am currently in my Master's researching **conversations between people with dementia and their younger relatives**. Currently, I am collecting quantitative data on what problems and/or feelings are attached to these conversations, to eventually design a product supporting the younger relative in these hard moments. 

I hope you can help me out by filling in this form, it takes approximately 10-15 minutes:

[https://forms.office.com/e/s6Pc2GLw2L](https://forms.office.com/e/s6Pc2GLw2L)

Thanks in advance, and I wish you all the strength to get through this difficult time.

Yours faithfully,

"My dad went into long term care in June 2022. He started to become incontinent and we were unable to take care of him at home. It took him some time to settle but in October they said he was gaining weight. Now, they said he’s losing weight even though he’s eating well. In this case, what should we do? I’m so worried :(",0
"hi there, i was wondering if anyone else has had this experience with their loved ones being on diazepam/valium. my grandfather has recently been moved into a nursing home and has escaped three times and was being rude to the nurses thinking that they had been keeping him hostage (when we visited, he wanted us to call the police etc) and so they put him on diazepam. since they put him on it, we've noticed he's been more restless than usual, he is being quite aggressive, he has been talking about suicide, and he just generally seems worse. has anyone else had this happen to their loved on on diazepam? thank you!

also, he has a prosthetic leg and he recently fell while trying to escape which has caused his non prosthetic leg to hurt. he now thinks that the painful leg is his prosthetic leg and is determined to walk on it which is causing him exteme amounts of pain. any advice on this (what we can tell him to calm him down etc) would be appreciated too :)",0
I was my grandfather's full time care giver for years and now he is gone.. he has been gone for years now. Lost him to covid in the beginning of 2020 and still haven't figured out how to live again.

"Half the time I end up not going.  Once I'm there I'm o.k.  it's the mental anguish of seeing her there that builds up and I feel like I'm having a heart attack.
My mom, tho we have our differences, was always the planner.  Every holiday she made special.  Beautiful table decorations, candles, the works.
Now she can't comprehend what's going on outside of her little world there in the nursing home.  She lives in a locked section, and always insists on going in her wheelchair to the locked doors to say goodbye.  I always, always cry all the way home.
So when I don't visit for extended periods, I feel massive guilt about not being able to put my emotions aside to bring her joy by visiting.
Sometimes she knows me, other times I have to explain I'm her daughter.
For 3 days now I've attempted to go visit and bring presents and decorations to add to her room.  I think I need to ask my son to go with me cause I just can't get out of the driveway.  I'm crying too hard.  I'm failing at being a good daughter.  It's just overwhelming.",0
I recently spoke to my uncle and he was all over the place. He was supposedly catching me up on events but they were all past events. He was also confusing the people in his stories.

He’s not dead and yet I’m here thinking I just want this nightmare to end, and then I feel guilty for thinking it. I don’t know how much more of this I can take.

I’ve been close with my dad my whole life. How do I describe all of that and all the feelings I felt then when he’s a completely different person now ? 

Are there templates ? I feel so overwhelmed.",0
"Got a call from my brother. My father is being taken to the hospital from the nursing home his is currently in. He has been holding food in his mouth and there is something wrong with his right clavicle. They said he looks ""defeated"". I am really scared that he is going to die within the next few days. I am just really scared and have been reading a lot about late stage dementia and it seems like he has been there for a while. Is there anything we can do to get him ""undefeated"" or is this close to the end. I am at a loss. If any of this feels insensitive or whatnot. It is not meant to be that way. I just don't know where to turn to.

"Hi all,

My grandfather is in a sub acute rehab facility until his Medicaid goes through. Ideally I would like him to have the most home care hours Medicaid can give. I see online that it is rare to get 24 hour home care, but was anyone able to do it? And if you have it, how did your loved one take having someone in their house 24/7? My grandfather loves his independence but can’t be alone at all. He is also very paranoid towards me and only me, I’m not sure if that would transfer to the health aide.

Also if you weren’t able to get 24 hour home care, what was the most you were able to get and has your quality of life since improved? Im hoping for at least 12 hrs a day. I feel like this is my last hope, otherwise a nursing home it will have to be.",0

I have a new dog in the home and she is house trained and has gone without accidents since I got her.

"Hey r/dementia,

I wanted to share a song/video that I recently made for my grandma. 

During the pandemic, I wasn't able to see her as much. When I did get to see her again the Alzheimers had made a huge impact on her memory. I was shocked and extremely hurt. 

I make music for a living and tried expressing myself. She raised me as a kid for years and is someone I love so much. I read a lot of posts on here and noticed there were so many people going through the same thing as me. 

I poured a lot of emotion and effort into this song and I'm really proud of how it turned out. I would love it if you could take a listen and let me know what you think, I hope to help anybody going through the same thing that I did. I'm also planning on donating a significant portion of the streaming revenue to the Alzheimer's Association, so if you enjoy the song and want to support the cause, please consider streaming it on your preferred platform.

Here's the link to the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYLAf5oFYfU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYLAf5oFYfU)

"Words of wisdom from my mom.

Some days are easier, some are harder.  I'm learning to change my home to be more comfy for elder care. I'm a gay man who loves antiques,  so most of my home has found itself boxed away.

Today I tried to do some cooking but half my kitchen utensils are now missing. She tossed or misplaced every one of my vintage carbon steel chef knives and the blacksmith made cooking tongs.... 

She realized I was upset and I acted like it wasn't a big deal, because its Christmas.  So I forced a happy mood and we did xmas shopping online. New cheap knives and tongs for me, and 9 boxes of candies that she thought looked yummy.

My aunt moved in to help take care of my mom, so she has her sister, her son and his hubby to be there for her.

"My dad has just been diagnosed with early onset dementia. He’s shown symptoms for many years but it’s just now official. He no longer goes to work, and now that I’m home from college for winter break, I’ve realized that he just watches Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee all day, every day on repeat. I’m trying to think of some things that won’t frustrate him too much that are fun for him to do so his days are monotonous. When we were talking today, he told me he wants a hobby now that he’s “retired.” I need some ideas.
Background on his past interests: He was an artist/photographer for many years so I bought him some charcoal pencils and blenders for him. He also used to play guitar. I set up his guitar stuff tonight (we moved a little while ago) so that he has that option but I’m afraid it may frustrate him. I need more ideas.

"Hi, seeking some advice. My partner's grandfather is on hospice. He's reached a point of not being responsive. His wife has dementia which has accelerated in the last year. She's easily confused, especially in an unfamiliar environment which she is in (my partner's parents' house).

Her kids keep having to remind her that he isn't going to get better. Her mood has seesawed from understanding and grieving and staying by his side for hours and hours to getting angry at him for ""still laying in bed."" He's reaching his final hours now, and she forgot again and is now angry at her children for ""keeping it a secret from her"" because, had she known, she would have worried sooner. But she HAS been worrying; she just forgot.

Do you have any advice?",0
"I was sort of marveling at myself last night at dinner and thought I would share with you all.  It's been a journey of frustration and anger for me - which is dumb.

One year ago me:  Dad - you can't move into an apartment - you can't even cook.  Dad (yelling) Yes I can!  I can take care of myself.  Me (yelling):  What are you talking about - you never knew how to cook - you don't drive, you can't shop, you need a lot of help.  Dad (yelling more, super angry): I DON'T NEED ANY HELP.    Me later:  I'm such a terrible daughter and he's a terrible Dad.

Today me: DAD:  So I need a place with a kitchen, a living room, bathroom and bedroom.  ME: Sounds good.  Dad:  I'm gonna ask Brianna (his 2x a wk caregiver) to help me find a place.  ME:  Great idea.   (Narrator:  Brianna placed him in the care home he's in now - he's not going anywhere.)

No fighting, no frustration.  Everyone tells you 'be in their world'.  But we all know from experience how hard it is to get your head around the fact that your LO can't be corrected, or set on the right track.  It's hard to accept that your LO is completely irrational and delusional.  I certainly am still learning - just Sunday Dad told me his boss was 'still at it' (he was a jerk) and I tried to tell Dad he's probably retired by now.  Then Dad said, ""no, he's walking around here!""  

Anyway, the sooner you learn what took me years to learn, the less pain and heart ache you create for yourself and your LO.

Peace all.  ",0
"So we finally had to put my uncle in memory care after discharge from rehab.  It was supposed to be temporary until we found one closer to the family (he’s out of state), but he wouldn’t leave, said he made friends, wouldn’t get in the car, etc. (separate post) and now he’s been there over 30 days. We happen to live in the area that has the highest average cost in the US for memory care (ridiculous $ as far as I’m concerned) I’m already unhappy with the place.  They made us give them a credit card for pharmacy charges, the cc bill for the month came to over $450.  We asked for an itemized bill, didn’t get one.  Had to call the pharmacy five times and got an itemized bill of which $79 is missing.   The pharmacy can’t find what $79 of the charges are for and were supposed to call me back but never did. I told them if I don’t see an itemized bill I’m disputing the charge.  $189 were drug copays - that’s fine.  The remainder were things like -$14.99, sharps container - huh? and $69 for Lidocaine patches.  Really?  I see them on Amazon for $10.  And other BS.  They constantly call my brother (POA) to say “he needs this, he needs that” or “we want to put him on so an so medication” but when we call with a question we don’t get an answer. I bought him vitamins, and was told to give them to the nurse…they disappeared.  Doctors come into the facility and bill. They said he didn’t need a phone and we could arrange with them to talk to him, but while we tried, that never happened. Now we got the “oh, he has a higher level of care than we thought” e-mail.  Is all this normal practice in MC or does it seem scammy?  What can we refuse without him getting kicked out?   Are all memory care facilities like this?  We’d love to move him, but he’s comfortable now.",0
"We made it to /r/all: [""Family questions if B.C. driving test is fair for mother with mild dementia""](/r/nottheonion/comments/zk3aau/family_questions_if_bc_driving_test_is_fair_for/).

Read the comments -- a rare, united 100% are against people driving who have any level of dementia.

Granted, Reddit heavily skews young where a lot of people lack empathy about this because they haven't had to face this situation.

But they're right.  (Not sure I'd ever say that.)  We've got to take the keys away or remove the car or, failing that, disconnect the battery or the fuel pump or something else so the car is ""broken, aw shucks, too bad it won't work"".

Taking away the driver's license?  Just means they'll drive illegally, they're unlikely to think that's a real obstacle if they're already not 100% in their right mind.

And we've got to hide the keys to our own cars.

I expect we all have stories.  When I was a kid, I overheard my father saying my grandfather drove directly through a stop sign, very nearly causing an accident, before my father took the keys away.  I hated taking the keys away from my own father -- and he always had spares, so I ""borrowed"" his car and never gave it back.  My mother was still pretty sharp but she drove up on a sidewalk and almost hit a doctor's office, and (bless them!) they took away her keys and called me to come get her.

**I know we all know this.**  But the nature of this subreddit is that new people keep coming in, and they keep asking about this issue, when there shouldn't be anything to ask.  (Except how to do it, maybe.)

(And I know that in car-dependent societies like the U.S. and Canada, removing the ability to drive is a critical blow to independence... and I know directly taking care of someone can be a critical blow to the caretaker's independence, for that matter.)",0

An update on where we are at with the film...

We  are focusing on film festivals through the majority of 2023, applying  through November. We haven't booked any yet (dangit). However, we are in  the Final Round for one in L.A. in June (hoorays!).

Festivals are  very clear about no public screenings or broadcasts prior to their  event. So, our current public distribution strategy is to wait until the  end of the year to offer WWD for sale, either physical DVDs/BluRays or  video on demand. 

We are creating private preview screenings and  working on invite only community screenings with potential partners  during the year. This does not affect our festival eligibility. We will  be offering these through various social media influencers and  subscribers to [https://www.winewomenanddementia.com/](https://www.winewomenanddementia.com/) so if you are interested do check out the website (new design!) and subscribe. 

And that's the scoops, poops. Keep on caring on, caregivers!

"My mother keeps getting frustrated with my dad that he’s not acting upon her instructions or remembering what she’s telling him. He’s 18 months into his diagnosis. He’s mostly calm and happy but is starting to make wrong decisions (flushing wipes he shouldn’t etc) I’m living with them for around 10 days a month. She is very intelligent and has no memory issues but doesn’t seem to comprehend that telling him that he needs to remember to do something is NOT GOING TO WORK. She has watched Teepa Snow, read the 36 Hour Day and this just doesn’t seem to be sinking in. I know she’s still adjusting but it just kills me that I can’t get this through to her.

Now my bf’s dad might have alzheimer’s but nothing is confirmed yet. My bf feels that his dad has started showing symptoms and is worried that he will get Alzheimers too around his dad’s age. 

I have told this to my parents and they don’t support my decision to be with him. I am unsure what to do. All I know is that I am happy with my bf and we will deal with it when the time comes. Please help me process my thoughts if anyone was in a similar situation.",0

"Goodbye, Daddy. I love you so much. I will miss you. 

I wish I had gotten more time with you. I had wanted you to see me get married and have children. You loved children.

You always worked so hard to provide for your family. You restored such beautiful award winning cars. You didn’t get much credit for them, but they are still winning awards to this day. 

You changed your life around to be there for Ashley and I when we were small. You worked so hard so we could be a family all together again. We had fun adventures to Yellowstone, Ireland, Arizona, and Disneyland together. You taught us how to play Checkers and Go Fish. You showed Ashley and me how to make paper airplanes. You would always made us bacon and eggs and give us tea. You loved bacon and eggs. And you loved apple pie on Christmas.

You always called us your “little angels,” and “sweethearts.” I know you loved all your children very much. 

I will miss you saying, “there’s my little angel,” when I would come to visit. I will miss seeing you sitting on the couch, watching TV. I will miss you telling stories about your brother and family in Ireland. I will miss you telling me about a car part I don’t understand. 

But you won’t be in anymore pain. I am happy you didn’t have to suffer through the worst part of Alzheimer’s for long. You wouldn’t had wanted to be taken care of like that. You were a proud man. I know Uncle Tom and Granny are waiting for their Billy Buff in Heaven. 

It must had rained today so you would had been reminded of Ireland when Heaven welcomed you. I’m glad Ashley and I were there to hold your hands and play one of your favorite songs, Let it Be, when you went to Heaven. 

I love you so much, Daddy. ❤️ 

Love,
 your little Angel Michelle

"Had a bad feeling come over me at lunch today. Called my mom the check on my father. Monday, we move him to hospice to transition from this life to the next place.

"My daddy hasn’t recovered after getting COVID and being in the hospital. He has declined and the nurses can’t get him to eat or drink water. He holds the water in his mouth and can’t swallow. 

Before he got COVID I feel he would had lived a lot longer. He had started missing the toilet but he wasn’t so bad yet. 

But now… after the trauma of being isolated and sedated he has declined severely. The nurses said he is at the end of his life now. And had us call hospice.  He seems to be in a lot of pain. Can’t swallow, can’t talk much. He tried to talk, but I don’t know what he said. I think he asked where my sister was. He still knew me. He wouldn’t let go of my hand. I read him stories. Im going tomorrow.

"This is an older post. My account has been banned from this subreddit. I don’t understand why you guys were mad at me, because I was just trying to help. I am currently in the process of trying to take down the r/alzheimersgroup subreddit due to multiple guideline violations, the most severe of which being targeting certain subjective groups with hate and and mislabeling the subreddit to begin with. It is a Garfield comic subreddit, not a alzheimers group. If I succeed in this the subreddit will be taken down. I am not doing this for you guys, because you were all mean as fuck to me while I was trying to help. I’m doing this for myself. But if I get one more fucking ounce of hate from this subreddit I may change my mind and let it stay up knowing what the effect will be. But I won’t be able to be blamed because apparently nobody ever wanted me to do shit in the first place. I am simply letting you know all of this.

Edit: also everyone saying I’m a “troll” or I’m an “irony poisoned piece of shit” fuck you honestly. I laid down everything to help this subreddit to begin with and I got treated like SHIT. Why? Because of the exact issue I was trying to fix. Maybe you guys have Alzheimer’s but I know you didn’t forget how to be a decent caring person.",0
"At the beginning of the August my dad got COVID and they put him in the COVID ward where he needed to have oxygen. I was told he was aggressive and they gave him something to calm him down… the Thursday before last, mom was called and they said she could get him; doc said he was walking, talking, and smiling. The hospital was supposed to move him to a nursing home since mom couldn’t handle him anymore so mom wanted to wait. He had left the sink on all night and incontinence was starting. It took them until Tuesday to move him. Mom saw him Wednesday and he was out of it. He Couldn’t wake up. The nursing home said the hospital had given him a high dosage of seroquel. However, it’s not on the medicine list we got from his check out. I went yesterday and he was barely awake, wasn’t eatting much and super loopy.

I’m not sure if his dementia has progressed so far suddenly that he can’t talk anymore or if he is coming off those horrible drugs they gave him….Mom spoon fed him some baby food and a protein shake and got him to drink a good amount of water. 

I felt so sad seeing him like that.",0

"My Dad’s GP seemed to be the one to break the news to my dad that they would be recommending to the DVLA that he should surrender his driving licence. They got him into the GP surgery on the premise that they needed him to come in for “routine blood tests” and discussed his ability to drive (he of course told the GP he was a totally safe driver) when they called him in for his blood test results a week after the tests (they never actually mentioned what the blood tests were or what the results were… my mum asked about them at the end of the appointment and the Doc just said “all fine”). 

He’s accepted (for now) that he is no longer the driver of the family and things seem to have settled down on that front.

That was at the end of May this year. 

Last week (late August) he received another letter from the GP telling him to make another appointment for more “routine blood tests”. We’re really worried that this is another ruse just to get him to the Doctor’s surgery again for a reason unrelated to any blood tests - apart from the ALZ, he’s in good physical health. The discussion about his ability to drive with his GP totally caught my mum off guard last time and upset my dad as they both thought the appointment was just to do with blood test results.  

We submitted an Attendance Allowance application in July (had a text acknowledging it had been received) and we obviously attached the diagnosis letter from the Memory Clinic etc. Could it be that this “routine blood tests” appointment is a way to get my dad in to be assessed for the attendance allowance suitability in any way? Has anyone else had any GP involvement with the attendance allowance application? We don’t want to be caught off guard again and my dad will obviously tell the GP that he’s fine and doesn’t need extra help with anything (he does). We don’t want the GP (who has met him once for 10 minutes) to make an assessment about whether he’s a worthy candidate for the extra £60 a week from DWP based upon a quick appointment, we ALSO don’t want for him and my mother to be blindsided again. Any UK input appreciated as always!",0
"After several week longs stays in the geri-psych, my dad is now on a bunch of sedatives, antipsychotics, etc—you know the drill. The meds do seem to help his mood. 

He is in a Medicaid facility now and he has entered what the docs have said is the moderate to severe stage. He is 71 and his body is healthy, so he paces all day long. He can’t really talk anymore or follow direction. 

I feel awful when I visit, which is often, but I just don’t know if I’m acting in his best interest. 

Should I be bringing something to do? Play dough? Radio? Finger paints? 

It shatters my heart that he just walks around all day long and eats a little bit here and there. His existence is so bleak and I just want to bring him some joy. 

Also, the impossible to answer….anyone with a similarly situated loved one know what to expect with timing for next stage? What is it? When? How bad does it get? 

Any suggestions and info is appreciated.",0
"This may seem obvious to some, but for others who are new to caregiving, I want to share some things that my Dad likes to do that maybe would help when things get crappy:

- watching old shows from when he was a young adult (for us, Johnny Carson and Barney Miller have been great)
- going on short walks around the area
- listening to music from his childhood/when he was a young adult and dancing to it together
- looking through old pictures of the family together and pointing out who is who
- making time to sit down at the table together to eat a meal

"My husband was admitted to hospital earlier this week following several bad weeks at home, where he was increasingly agitated, aggressive and paranoid.

"In July 2022 my mother was officially enrolled in a Managed Long Term Care Plan (MLTC) and it was completely voluntary because I’m only 25 and I’m the sole caregiver for my mother. By early August I requested dis enrollment from the MLTC plan because no services were rendered. No Home aides showed, my mothers care manager never returned my called until I complained to corporate. The dis enrollment papers were signed and sent by mid August and said to be in effect on Sept 1st. Well, the day came and I called Medicaid attempting to get my mother back into the New York State health care and come to find out my mothers Medicaid was successfully ended but she’s still in the MLTC plan. I cannot express how devastated I was. I felt so dumb for trusting in the system. After 5 phone calls to several different gov’t hotlines I finally got in touch with the MLTC complaint hotline and a case is now open. The rep who I spoke to said that as long as a mandate isn’t on my moms account the dis enrollment should have been successful like the Medicaid dis enrollment. Once I got off the call I researched the MLTC mandate and now I’m scared my mom is unfortunately stuck in this MLTC. She was only approved for 3.5 hours of home aide assistance a day and will be eligible for Medicare in December. Now my mother has no health insurance and will very likely be charged the full amount for the MLTC. I have no idea what to do, does anyone have any advice?",0
"I have a lot of questions, and no real experience. Does it make it harder to take care of or be diagnosed as a person with Alzheimer’s if you live in a small town or away from any city?  Is it common to need to move to a larger city closer to more amenities? How do you get help for or find information about Alzheimer’s? Is the community helpful? Is technology helpful?! I know of ALZ, and they try to coordinate resources for patients and caregivers, are they useful in rural areas?

I ask because there is a grant for rural dyads of caregiver and a person with dementia living together and it’s been difficult reaching rural communities.  I don’t want to shitpost so I won’t elaborate.

From what I understand there are usually networks of resources from websites and brochures to online advocates who really try to encourage the communities. But I imagine these networks are very limited to rural areas.  And I would imagine that it’s up to schools, churches and townships to coordinate help and share information.

My heart goes out to the stories on here. I can’t imagine what it is actually like, for both you and those struggling.",0
"My dad got his diagnosis in December ‘21 and I am now getting to the point where I am letting myself just enjoy spending time with him instead of constantly playing over how bad he could get in my head. For now he’s happy, he’s different but he’s happy and he knows he is loved. I feel somehow irresponsible if I let myself just live in the moment with him, for the week every month I stay with him and my mum, like I’m tempting fate. Anyone else get that?",0
"My dad (68) is undiagnosed but in the process of getting one. My mom (55) has taken over his bank account and pensions from retirement. She is draining him. She is so bad at making financial decisions that I am worried that if he needs home help, there won't be anything left from his 401k to take care of them. I have tried to get POA but at this point my dad trusts my mom completely and won't even discuss anyone else taking over his finances. Has anyone else had this experience? Is there anything I can do? Neither of them understand that I am trying to help. My dad thinks I'm trying to steal his money and my mom thinks I am butting in. She is his wife and is allowed to spend his money. He doesn't have a problem with it, why should I? The thing is if he was in the right state of mind he would never allow her to spend the way she is. My dad is the type of person to lose sleep over a $100 and in the last 6 months my mom has spent close to $100,000. I know we have a long road ahead of us if his diagnosis is alzheimer's and I just want to make sure my dad is taken care of.",0

"My mother-in-law is part of a caregiver support group, and she asked us for help putting together a resources guide. Last week, people in her support group voiced the fact that there are so many resources / products / services for caregivers and patients, but it's absolutely impossible to figure out what's actually useful. They wished there was a handy list they could consult. For example, one member of her group tried a couple of fall detectors and wasn't happy with them, but wondered if there was something better out there. We offered to do some research for her as a way to contribute, and I wanted to ask for the wisdom of this group. 

1) Has there been anything (whether a product or service) that has been really helpful and you would recommend it to anyone?

2) Has anything been a disappointment?

3) Are there guides / lists that you use regularly that we can share with them?

"Hi! 
I am uploading all of our home videos to the app Plex for my Nana (in nursing home, Alzheimer’s) to view on her iPad. 

What do you think would be the easiest way to title the videos/folder so that she understands what they are?

I have a feeling I shouldn’t have a bunch of folders, I should just have the videos. But I don’t know how to title them in a way that she understands which one she would like to watch. 

Most are just copies of old VHS tapes, and just a mishmash of clips ending up being around 3h per tape. I welcome doing work, do you think I should separate all of the clips from the tapes and name them individually? If I do that it would end up being around 100 different video files and I worry that would be too overwhelming. 

Right now they are (original unchanged titles, brackets indicate what they contain)

-        Claire (clips from around the time learning how to walk, end of video is toddler)
-        Claire 2000 Feb-July
-        Claire (from around the same time as first Claire file)
-        Claire (toddler, walking, must be around 2nd birthday)
-        Claire baby (probably in between first “Claire” file and the “Claire” one where I was a toddler 
-        Claire Nov 99
-        dvd3 (Claire probably around 3yr old)
-        DVD4 (Claire and Simon around 2004)
-        DVD8 (Claire and simon around 2004 again)
-        Karen and Dave Wedding
-        Karen Medical School Graduation

"I (male 31), am a little fearful: my mom was diagnosed last year with Alzheimer's disease after experiencing a lot of paraphasia.  Her spinal tap showed significant levels of tau and AB, and her specialist based on that and cognitive tests diagnosed her with early stage Alzheimer's disease. 

I have a large family, my mom is the youngest of nine.  None of my mom's brothers or sisters and none of my older cousins (who are in their early 50s at the oldest) have exhibited any symptoms.  With that, I spent a lot of time reading about Early onset Alzheimer's disease this morning, particularly the genetic mutations like PSEN-1, and I'm terribly freaked out.  I can deal with my mom's cognitive decline, but the prospect of inheriting the disease and developing it early is quite distressing to me. 

Is it likely that I would've inherited an Alzheimer's mutation given that no one in my very large family have exhibited any early symptoms?  I'm panicking a little because I've dealt with myoclonus for a couple years, which is apparently associated with early onset but not late onset.",0

"Researchers have been investigating Hericium erinaceus, (monkey head mushroom, Lion's Mane)  as a possible treatment for Alzheimers Disease (AD). 

In this paper the writers evaluated six preclinical (animal studies) and three clinical studies. 

A limited number of clinical studies have been conducted *(6 so far; this paper is only including the first three)* and several clinical trials are ongoing, which have thus far shown analogous outcomes to the preclinical studies.

"After moving my Mom into a memory care facility this week, my Dad's been coming down on my brother and I to take care of ourselves and make sure our PCPs know about this family history of EOAD (Mom was dx in 2019 at just 61 years old, her father also dx with EOAD but eventually succumbed mostly to T2d complications). Apparently someone along the way over the past few years had mentioned that early warning signs of Alzheimer's could show up at least 20 years before an EOAD dx.

"We’ve been talking about putting him in memory care for about a year a half now, but it’s always been something I never thought we’d get to. Not because we didn’t want him to go, but because I never thought my mom would finally let him go. I know it’s normal to not know what to feel, but I didn’t realize it’d be so conflicting. 

My family’s mental health has definitely decreased over the years while caring for him; my mom was fallen into a hard depression and has just been prescribed antidepressants. I know deep in my gut that this is the right choice. He has progressed so fast and became so aggressive with this disease and has shoved and manhandled me and my mom several times. He had his flaws and we didn’t have the best relationship, but he always provided for us and worked hard. It sucks because he deserved to be a normal old man and rest. 

My mom said that she realized she had to put him in somewhere because she couldn’t go on anymore and because she didn’t want to lose her love for him by cleaning up his bodily fluids everyday, as he’s been starting to do everyday these past couple of months. And I don’t judge her at all, I want her to put herself first for once after 4 years.

"For anyone with a loved one affected by alzheimers, I wanted to recommend asking your doctor if they qualify for hospice care. The patient doesn't need to be near end of life to qualify which is something we didn't know and wished we did.

My mom was diagnosed about 6 years ago and is in the later stages of the disease. Her neurologist helped us by making a recommendation to start hospice care and it's been a huge help. 

As soon as we were approved they came THE NEXT DAY and did an assessment and by the end of the week they had started coming twice a week to assist with bathing, they brought supplies, oxygen and medications, a social worker and a nurse visited, and other services were offered. All covered by Medicare.

I can't speak all hospice organizations, we're getting help from Hospice Austin. But it wasn't an option we were aware of and it's been life changing for us. I hope others can find some support the same way.",0

On one side, you want them to last as long as they can. On the other, it's kind of relief to see that they won't be suffering from this god awful shitty disease soon.

"My mom was diagnosed 4 years ago at 64. She is stage 5-6. It’s really starting to take a toll on us. 

My dad just mentioned that there’s no way to pay for a caretaker or home without using a hefty amount of savings. Is this really true? They have decent health insurance, but he said health insurance does not cover care. Are there no government programs? 

My dad mentioned the cost for a home/caretaker. It is so unfair to ask $60k a year for something like this. That would wipe out my dad’s retirement savings. It is also unfair to ask any human to drop their life, as it is a full-time job and beyond depressing.

"My father (78) has had alzheimer's for many years now.    
[https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/guide/alzheimers-disease-stages](https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/guide/alzheimers-disease-stages)

When looking at the stages of alzheimers he exceeds all the mental characteristics for stage 6.  

He can neither communicate (it is all babble), he is incontinent (in diapers), and otherwise entirely incapable of caring for himself.  He doesn't recognize me or my brother, and he often doesn't recognize my mother.  He yells at the man in the mirror.  My mother is his caregiver and had to start locking the gates to the yard so that he doesn't get picked up by police for trying to break into other's houses claiming it is his house.    


Physically however, he seems fine.  He can walk, he isn't physically infirm and outside of his mental health is overall not unhealthy.

The big issue is that he has been getting increasingly violent.    


He punched my mother, grabs her and tries to hurt her (twist her arm), sprayed her with spraypaint after she tried to take it away when he was ""tagging the house"", kicked my toddler child, etc.    


There have been times where he has grabbed knives and refused to put them down.  He wasn't actively threatening people at that time but I would worry about a time where his violent tendencies and fixation with knives might intersect.  


He is already on medication for anger.    


My mother cannot afford to put him in a home, and respite care is rather useless for the problem of intermittent violence.  She cannot even go to support groups because they can't handle him while she is with the support group.  


What are our options here?  If it weren't for the increasingly violent tendencies my mother (the saint) wouldn't have a problem taking care of him.  With his overall physical health, I don't think palliative care or hospice care would be covered.  


Any options that won't bankrupt my mother or expose her to violence here?",0
My mom was just diagnosed a few weeks ago and my dad travels a lot for work. I also work during the day and am unable to visit her everyday when my dad is gone. For the most part she is fine but gets a lot of anxiety and will often call my dad and I during the day. Do you all have any advice?,0

"I'm feeling frustrated. Just a vent. 34 yo only child/daughter for my father. Suffers from alzheimers, he was diagnosed september 2019. I'm at a loss as to why he is calmer with me, yet the caregiver who stays with him while I'm at work complains he is aggressive and has aggressive moments with him. 
I have limited social life, the person who best understands aka my partner has a similar situation with his father, I lost our child due to incompetent cervix in february and i fear i may not be able to handle both a high risk pregnancy and my father. 
I'm educated but stuck in a lower paying job because it's closer to home and they know my situation so I can't afford around the clock help or a home for him. Yet if I get a higher paying job, chances are it takes me to the capital of my country that is a couple hours away and my control issues won't like that.

"My mother was diagnosed 7 years ago when she was 59. I have been living with my parents since then to help on the farm and in the house to take the stress off of my dad. He has had some medical problems so we had to put mom in a small private care home. I have only visited once and it was the worst thing I have experienced. She was so mad she wouldn't talk to dad or I and would cry everytime she looked at me. It took a week of crying everyday to sort of get over that visit. Since then she has been put on anti depressants and I'm told she is a lot happier now. But now I think about her being happy in there and I feel like crying. Most days are hell for me unless I can keep myself busy with work. I feel like a terrible son for agreeing to put her in a home even when I know it's for the best. I hate myself for wishing this this could just be over. I just don't know how to deal with this disease anymore and it's only going to get worse.

My grandma passed away from covid a few months ago. Me and my family moved to Florida from Missouri when I was 8(the state where my whole family lived) and we came back to missouri when I was 16. She had vascular dementia for as long as I remember. While we were living in Florida her mind deteriorated more and more by time we moved back she didn’t know who I was or her kids or herself. I didn’t grow up or see her very much my whole life since I moved away when I was young. She got covid and was in the hospital for a few days. We got to see her on a video call. We talked to her telling her to get well soon and stay strong. While we were talking to her she said I want to go home in the most heartbreaking way I’ve ever heard. She died soon after that call sometime around the next morning. We were told that she didn’t have very  much time and we drove fast to the hospital but by time we got there she was already gone. My cousin was the one who was there overnight and we met him outside the hospital when we got there it was really cold outside and snowing.,0

I'm only at the early stages of grief 2 months in after losing my dad to Alzheimer's already seeing all the father's day promotions is making me cry not meaning to just an advert on tv or see a son with his dad a tear started rolling down.

Seems to be no money put into Alzheimer's at all it all goes to the big c yet Alzheimer's is slowly catching up to the death numbers seems to be the new term for getting old and it's hard to know what actually made my dad go cause they never do investigations into it or anything.

I feel angry when I see 90 years olds who shouldn't be behind the wheel of a car and then my dad is gone forever. He was a good man and a great man.

It just questions why do they get to still play golf with their dad or go to the odd music concert saw eric Clapton before he went weird, the colors and Phil Collins was luckier. He played rugby and i think that's where he suffered cause of the head injuries seems to affect allot of sporting people

"My (28 F) mother (60F) has early onset Alzheimer’s.

She is the first in my family line to have Alzheimer’s and is believed to have a one time mutation that may or may not now be hereditary.

"My mom has always been kind of spacey and ditzy. She’s a constant worrier and has anxiety.

Within the past year since she’s started dating ( she’s a widow of 12 years ) and just a year in general. I’ve notice some short term issues.

I visited her this weekend. Prior to the visit she would ask almost every day the dates I was coming.

Today after I got back home. She asked where my fiancé put my dress. And then asked again 10 mins after 

My niece was with us and she kept asking her when her mom was picking her up

Other than that she’s sharp. She can remember what days she off work. Birthdays. What she did the day before. Sometimes she’ll be like oh! I have this story I meant to tell you about work. Or hey this is what the pastor talked about today.

She told me she’s distracted. She’s worried about my brother going to another county next month. Worried about me trying to have kids cause I’m 34 and she hopes I am able too. Worried about these men who are playing her.

I guess I worry cause my grandma had dementia she lived with it for a while about 15 years. I don’t know if it’s old age. Distraction. Or dementia. She doesn’t deserve this and I’m so scared.

I wonder why he can tune into the plot so well when other stuff goes entirely over his head nowadays, even stuff he’s seen multiple times before.

"I felt the need to share my experiences and emotions at the end. I (38/F) have felt relief and even joy knowing he is no longer trapped in a body and life he no longer understood.

A week prior to his death, he was still ambulatory without the aid of walkers or canes. However, he fell as the nurses were assisting him in the his shower and broke his hip. There was a significant dive in what was left of his cognitive function and he continued to decline. Five days after the fall, we were mercifully transferred to a hospice facility where the nurses kept him comfortable the last 3 days of his life. 

I am so grateful to all of the nurses who were so kind and caring to him as well as myself and other family members to make sure we had food, drinks, blankets, and any other items to help us stay comfortable as we took shifts sitting by his side from the moment he was admitted to the hospital. Wonderful volunteers came through to say hello and lend a listening ear as well as word searches, coloring pages, and other materials to help us pass the time. The cleaning staff was equally attentive and kind  always speaking with my grandfather as they made their rounds and checking on me when I would step out of the room to walk a quick lap around the floor when I had to recenter myself. So much kindness and care. They are all truly angels on earth. 

My grandfather’s battle with Alzheimer’s was adjourned at age 81 on May 21 at 9:01 pm - 11 years after his diagnosis. He was my father figure and my idol. He was the man all men in my life always have and always will be measured against. He raised me alongside my mom and grandmother. It was grueling and so horrible to see him deteriorating and knowing that no matter what you do, you can no longer reach him where he was.

Our family was fortunate that both of his children (daughters) and 3 grandchildren (all granddaughters) were surrounding his bed with our spouses supporting us as he finally took his calm last breath.

I felt bad for feeling such relief, but it’s because he’s finally free and able to be rejoined with my grandmother. I honestly felt like I had finally gotten my granddaddy back the minute he drew his last breath. I turned to my husband and said “He knows who I am again.” It was a truly beautiful moment and I’m so thankful he is free from this disease.",0

We’d like to build on this existing research and create something that’s accessible (for those without access to established music therapy programs), and has less demand on caregivers and care providers.

If this concept sounds interesting to you, we’d love for you to [join our community](https://bit.ly/381gkO9) to receive updates, invitations for beta testing and product research (you’d be compensated for your time).

We’re also currently [conducting a paid survey](https://bit.ly/37ZR2zM) for healthcare professionals who work with people living with Alzheimer’s.

The goal is to learn as much about the varying needs as possible, to create a product that can be truly impactful. Thank you!",0
Has anyone here had any success with using cameras to monitor their loved ones? My mother has Alzheimer's & lives with me but I can't watch her 24/7. She can move around on her own just fine & is ok by herself for short periods of time but my sister & I would both like a way to check in on her without invading her space too much. I work from home & it would be helpful to be able to see what she's up to without having to stop working. There are so many options for indoor cameras that it's a little overwhelming. I would appreciate any advice.,0
"My mother is rapidly declining and I’m extremely frustrated that despite all the recent evidence that FMT could be an incredibly effective treatment, it’s not being made available or being promoted. Does anyone have more information on this?

"Hello! My girlfriends dad has Alzheimer's. It's a stage where he has just now been moved to a full time care taking facility. He got moved there last week, and she just visited him there for the first time. Some people in her family keeps telling her, that she isn't doing enough. Which is not okay in my eyes.
Obviously she is very affected, and especially because he keeps asking to come home again, which breaks her heart and in turn mine.
And so, i was just wondering if you guys have any advice for me, as to how i can really support her in this, because it's a little hard for me to really understand her feelings, since I've never been in that situation.
And if you have advice i could bring her that might have helped some of you guys cope?

Thanks alot, and i wish you all the best of luck through your difficult times.",0

"My grandfather was in the navy, he was known as
onion for his tendency to make other men cry. I'm
visiting my grandparents for the first time in years
and he needed help finding the light switch in his
own home to go upstairs to bed. I showed him
where but he turned it on and then off so I told him
""you hit it twice"" and he replied ""just fix it""

I’ve known how bad it can be for a while but now it's
really hitting me hard. I need to fly back in a
couple weeks and leave my poor old grandma to
help him all on her own. First I've cried in
years, because sure I'd be sad if anything happened
to my parents, the difference is that my
grandparents are kind hearted pure people who took me in for a crucial couple of years that turned my life around. My mother was negligent and by grade 4 I couldn’t read or write, I didn’t even know left from right, literally.

My nan shouldn’t have to start nursing again at her age but she’s convinced pop wouldn’t be happy without her care. Caring for him is so demanding but she wouldn’t hear a bar of putting him into someone else’s care, even brought up the plot of The Leisure Seeker to me 😂 I guess she can relate to that movie but of course wouldn’t do that",0

"It is undeniable that explaining Alzheimer’s to children is no simple task. Children may not understand why their grandparent, who once used to take care of them, picked them up from school or gave them a snack, can no longer do those things. Therefore, the first thing we should do is to **explain to the child what is happening to their grandparent in language that is suitable for the child’s age**.

“Your grandpa (or grandma) has Alzheimer’s, a disease that causes the brain to forget things.” But Alzheimer’s is not just memory loss, and the child needs to be able to understand all the other symptoms little by little.

"My dad keeps passing dementia tests I have no idea how, because he loses his phone, keys etc etc multiple times a day and doesn’t remember conversations from yesterday. So I guess we are in a moderate phase atm? He has Parkinson’s so likely PDD, time will tell. In the meantime he is fixated on his phone and manages to lock himself out of email, apple and other accounts (Netflix etc) multiple times a day. It is an anxiety thing and kind of fidget toy for sure so we don’t want to take it away completely, because I think he’ll get combative. But it’s frustrating that iPads & Phones constantly prompt for ID login for example because he responds compulsively to the prompt and then gets locked out yet again. 

For the first time today after 3 hours on the phone with his provider I did not tell him I’ve managed to reset his email password because it’s attached to my moms email and their internet/landline/cable account and he would inevitably get them all locked again in a day. 

My 75 year old mom is not good with tech at all and is scrambling to find a way to direct his fixation without it impacting everything. 

Any success or suggestions with this issue? Aside from taking them away completely because we are not there yet. He will let me have his phone sometimes so I could try using some of the child controls I just don’t know which would be most helpful. We do have alerts on the bank accounts and are starting the PoA process, but it’s hard because as I say he still passes tests at the GP, gerontologist and neuro doc. He’s a retired doctor and so I think he’s really good at showtiming.",1
"Hello all,

As the title says, I'm looking for experiences with or thoughts on moving furniture around and how patients/loved ones with dementia react to it. My grandpa has vascular dementia, Parkinsonian symptoms, and significant physical declines from two large strokes. He uses a rollator to walk, but we know a wheelchair is going to be necessary very soon. With the Parkinsonian symptoms he's walking on his toes, knees constantly bent, and shuffling horribly. We've been noticing that he's having a harder time supporting his weight with his legs, someone having to hold him up when getting out of a car or him holding onto doorframes and pulling himself along while his knees bend more and more. He also had two falls around the summer of last year caused by his feet getting tangled around each other when trying to turn, as the house is incredibly narrow and the furniture layout does not help. In the two rooms he spends the most time in, bedroom and living room, there's a lot of excess furniture and very narrow walkways. We're at a point where it's when, not if, his legs collapse out from underneath him or his legs get tangled up again and he falls. My mom and I are considering the idea of moving furniture around in these rooms so that there are better walkways, open areas to turn his rollator around, and helping us in the future when he inevitably needs a wheelchair. However, my grandpa has lived in the house for close to 60 years with the furniture set up the same way the whole time. We moved the kitchen table last night as a gauge, and according to my mom he was cranky this morning and was making comments about it ""being no good."" I feel like if we move his furniture around, especially his bedroom, it's going to be quite a few days of him being cranky and irritated. However, I think it might be worth it to help him be more mobile, and help us when he needs a wheelchair. I also feel like moving furniture around and causing a disturbance to his routine would be the same thing that would happen if we were to put him a memory care facility (we wish, but they're too expensive).

Does anyone have any thoughts or experiences with this? Or other ideas on what we could do to help him?",1
"The people at the nursing home my grandfather lives in recently told me he is being combative. I have been nagging them constantly about making sure his face is shaved and his hair is cut; and it turns out the reason he isn't always is that he's been hitting and kicking the facility members when they try to do so. I was only recently informed of this, but apparently, it's been going on for months. I feel like a huge jerk for nagging them when their physical safety was in jeopardy.",1
"My uncle has been in memory care for almost three months now.  We still don’t know how this happened as we noticed no no sign of cognitive decline, he had a small accident and the doctors told us he needed MC.  That aside, I’m not sure what I expect, but so far it wasn’t this especially while paying $11,000+ a month.  So the first thing was as soon as he moved in and was settled and comfortable, the facility called and said “we need to move him up a care level (meaning more $$$).  Then they sent him to the emergency room because apparently he said he wanted to kill himself.  The ER did nothing but asked him, he said he didn’t remember saying that and they sent him back to MC. (Cha-Ching $$$).  Then they said he’s combative and uses foul language (um, so do I) and they wanted to give him Ativan and put him on a dose of .25 mg.  Then they sent him to the Emergency room (cha-Ching $$$) again because his belly button was red and looked infected (why would that happen unless he wasn’t being cleaned? ) ER sent him back with an antibiotic. Then they called again and said they wanted to up his dose of Ativan to .5 mg.  I thought people with dementia shouldn’t even be prescribed Ativan?  We asked why they keep sending him to the ER.  They said “ because you have no general practitioner on file.” Ummm… shouldn’t someone have told us this?  How are we supposed to know the process? We have now signed up for the facility doctor, only to find out that only nurse practitioners come to the facility, not doctors.  Through the facility, we scheduled FaceTime meetings with him since we’re out of state, which they said they would help with.  1/2 the time they don’t show up or are 1/2 hour late. I get it, the caretakers are are busy and I don’t blame them, but for the cost of the facility, I expected more.  Am I expecting too much?  What are your experiences?",1
"The oncologist gave my mom 6 months in November (mom has stage 1 multiple myeloma, a typically slow progressing cancer). Despite knowing this, the more experienced gerontologist estimated as much as 3-4 years in January. Hospice nurses in early February guessed my mom would have a year or two. So I’m trying to crowdsource some estimates based on my mom’s functional (rather than cognitive) progression/symptoms. 

In early December, my mom walked carefully but quite well on her own. Then, she pulled a muscle in her thigh while getting into the caregiver’s vehicle and began to use a walker. However, as she recovered from the pulled muscle, she got around using the walker really well and would sometimes even walk short distances without it.

But, starting in late February, she began to shuffle and partly drag her legs with the walker, and now she needs a wheelchair on most outings.

Though she’s still fully continent and toilets on her own and at appropriate times and can chew and swallow and feed herself just fine, this rapid loss of walking ability is striking and makes me wonder how close we might be inching to the end. I know it’s impossible to answer this with any certainty, but I’m trying to be prepared.

So I’m wondering, when your loved one began to lose the use of their legs, what did their progression look like from there?",1
"Dad sometimes in the evening is convinced he is in the wrong home and needs to go home. Even wanting to call the police to take him there. Sometimes redirection helps and sometimes not.

"On my previous posts, I talked about my dad’s hallucinations, combative behavior, and trying to run away from assisted living. He became aggressive with two caregivers and ended up being hospitalized for chest pain. 

The ER doctors consulted with his doctor and they placed him on Seroquel and Ativan. Two days later he fell and was taken to the ER again because he is on Warfarin and is a risk for bleeding. They had to sedate him to get him back to his ALF.  

After three days he never came out of sedation and could no longer swallow. All his meds were halted. He would only moan and not open his eyes. 

Yesterday an IV was started. He drank part of an Ensure. We were hopeful he would wake. This morning I went to see him and he was writhing in pain and delirious. I made the call to start comfort care. What have I done? I moved my father to be closer to me and in a week he will probably be gone. 

I fucking hate dementia!!",1
"Before you crucify me for asking this, let me provide context.

My father was diagnosed in late 2018 with dementia. Since then, he has turned into a very aggressive and angry person. He routinely tells me to F off, threatens to shoot me, tells me i'm not his son and makes racist remarks left and right.

He has called my mom awful things, but she refuses to medicate him ""because she feels bad"". She refuses to dump him in a facility, because ""she pities him"". At this point, I just look forward to his passing (as awful as that sounds). He now has an alcohol problem because my mom is scared of him when he gets angry. He routinely tries to pack his suitcase and leave the house.

He genuinely scares me. He has access to a loaded hand gun and just the other day manhandled my 10lb dog for ""barking too much"". I told him to let my dog go and he insisted the dog was his and for me to get out of his house and get hit by a car.

How long do people with dementia typically last? He is 78 and has no other health problems, except a daily pill he takes to lower his blood pressure.",1
"I’m 65, my husband is 77. He has been drinking and smoking pot for the past 12 years and i’m sure it adds to the dementia he already has. He accuses me of cheating on him, sneaking out of the house to meet guys, he has said he SAW me kissing the neighbor by the house, many times. He tells everyone i drugged his coffee and was genuinely convinced he was with drawling from hard drugs for the whole weekend. 

I’m having a hard ass time with this. I know he can’t help it, but i think the drinking has really made his dementia worse. He’s been recently diagnosed and the hallucinations started in 2019 and got worse this last december. He’s been in sober living since christmas 2022, but his delusions and hallucinations are still there due to his dementia. 

Is anyone out there dealing with a spouse like this? I need help. Where do i go to from here, what do i do?",1
"Father in law finally got in to gerologist, who said probably LBD. We've known something was wrong and suspected Parkinson's or dementia. He sees random (hallucinatory) people in the house almost on the daily.

I thought we would be more prepared for this moment but it's tougher than we thought. LBD seems so grim from my online reading. 

What advice would you offer caregivers staying this journey?

Edit: we moved him from with financially abusive son across the country into our basement 6 months ago and were shocked to see how much he'd changed. How much we'd missed by seeing him on occassion or chatting on the phone but not living with him. The past 6 months alone has been a lot of sorting through *so many* unpaid bills and getting him to take his pills again, eating properly, reminding him he has diabetes, fishing out misplaced items and retraining him not to hide his wallet.",1
"Feeling a bit down. This Saturday, my family will be placing my grandmother in a skilled nursing home. My mother has been trying her best to take care of my grandmother for a while now but it's become too hard. She needs 24/7 care. I personally found the care center myself and I'm very nervous she is going to hate it.

When visiting the place, there seemed to be a lot of happy older people and super nice nurses but I don't think that's going to matter too much to my Grandma. She will most likely hate it. With dementia coming into her life, I feel that it's going to be the hardest adjustment yet. I'm scared she will give up and pass away mad/sad.

I know my family, including myself will visit her often. She will most likely have one visitor per day. I'm sitting with her now as I write this out. She seems to be her normal self right now and I don't take that for granted. I'm glad we can have a few good times left but I'm super anxious about what's to come in the next couple of weeks/months.

I do get a sense of relief that my mom will be able to sleep through the night and not have to attend her full time. She deserves to live her life and get back to a normal routine. She's a hero. 

  
Thanks for letting me vent friends.  I know a lot of you have it worse but I felt I could vent with people in semi-similar situations. I wish everyone strength and love during these tough times.",1
"I am usually a reasonably positive person but the future is looking bleak and depressing.  I am in an early-ish stage where I think there's something happening with my mother but I don't have a diagnosis as of yet. I'm not even in the thick of it but I am finding it hard at times. The anger, the needless criticism, the odd things.

Dementia is such a disgusting condition.   The brain fails and its slowly and everyone suffers.  From the patient to the family and even finances suffer. Life really shouldn't be this hard. 

If this was kidney failure there would be dialysis. If this was gangrene in a foot, there would be amputation. If the bowel was failing there would be a stoma. There would be some treatment available if this was any other organ failure or cancer.
Dementia is so, so cruel.

I don't have a diagnosis as of yet but I think there is something happening with her.

You would think there would be more research and some sort of treatment or cure or something to slow it down.  

Getting a diagnosis is so depressing. She seems to be OK sometimes and then other times she doesn't talk and there's no conversation and she she just sits in her chair. Then she takes items of my clothing. The anger issues are unreal.  The anger is not new. I suppose she was always domineering but I think it's getting worse.",1
"Hello
It's been a long few months so forgive me if this is an awkward read.. I'm just writing it down as it comes to me..

My grandma has been on a mental decline for a while now, memory issues, trouble finding words and speaking, forgetting every day things and recent events and having trouble caring for herself..

We've been asking her to get tested but both her and my dad always insisted there was nothing wrong with her, we think they just didn't want to admit it..

Sadly, my dad passed away suddenly a couple months ago, and we think the loss of her only child is just speeding up the process.. she's more and more forgetful, lashing out, becoming paranoid, convinced everyone is out to get her and trying to screw her over when all we've done is try to help her... we're pretty sure she's even forgotten he passed a few times.

We're worried about her getting to the point where she can't care for herself but won't let anyone care for her... we know she'll never get tested on her own, won't move in with anyone, and won't let anyone move in with her... She's already blown me off meeting up for lunch because she thought I was going to ask that..

Any advice? We all live out of state, and we're all at a loss at what to do...

Thank you",1
"My hometown is a plane ride away. A year and a half ago we moved my mom from her home and to assisted living close to us. She has LBD.

I am scheduled to go to my hometown in a month to get the home cleaned out and on the market. Originally I had planned to bring my mom, she loves it there, has a community, and needs closure. She is also increasingly needing help with everything, being with her is pretty full on.

I was cracking from stress and decided I needed to just do the trip on my own, it was too much to handle all that needs to get done in a few days and supervise her.

She is understandably upset and doesn’t understand. She thinks she is capable of going up there all on her own. That she is “strong” and we don’t have to worry about her falling. Which of course, that’s not the main concern.

Going up there isn’t totally off the table, I think I can make a trip up again during the Juneteenth weekend where we can make it just about visiting people and enjoying ourselves. But she’s not having it.

I know I’m making the right choice but hearing her disappointment is heart wrenching. On some level I think this is frustration about her total loss of control over her life, which I’m sympathetic to.

And I’m not sure how to address head on her lack of capabilities. She’s heard her diagnosis before but she seems to brush it off. If you bring it up she just gets upset.

I don’t really know what to do.",1

"My father moved into a memory care unit yesterday. He’s on the second level out of three, I believe. They say that they stress that individuals there maintain independence. However, my father really needs extra help. 

My dad in the past year has had serious hygiene issues and aversion to showers. They say there is a salon that opens every Tuesday and he has to sign up for a slot to be groomed. I visited today, and he looks just the same. Wearing the same clothes, still unshaven, still not bathed (it’s in his treatment plan to bathe daily. 

He really can’t do so many simply tasks unassisted, but he also doesn’t have a clue how to ask for help and I’m having a lot of trouble already trying to find staff members who exist on his floor. 

My father can unfortunately barely get a coherent sentence out and when he does get a sentence out, I’m having to try to decipher it. How can I expect him to get the care he needs if these people really just want them to maintain independence, when he truly needs some guidance? Why are we paying $12k a month and I’m the only one still actively trying to get things in order? 

I’m so confused. I hope this makes sense",1
"I am a 38M and I haven't lived a healthy lifestyle the majority of my life and I currently suffer from various health issues now. Dementia runs on both sides of my family as both of my grandparents on my moms side had dementia & my grandma on my dads side had it as well. I am unsure of my grandpa on my dads side as he passed from a massive heart attack rather young. 

My parents are no longer married & I do not live near my dad, but both of my parents have suffered various severe health issues and both stopped working in their 50's and are on disability. I see my mom the most and she's noticed my memory has been slipping and mixing words (calling something a different name than what it is, etc). 

My symptoms:

1. I'll open the cabinet under my TV to grab something, forget to close it, go back and watch TV and a few minutes later noticed the cabinet still being open even though it's been in my face for several minutes.
2. I'll use the restroom and forget to turn off the light when leaving the room, notice my mistake a few minutes later and turn it off. 
3. I've been forgetting to lock my car when walking away from it. 
4. While driving, I feel like I really have to focus & concentrate more than I should/used to. Examples: Nearly driving away with the car in the wrong gear (Drive instead of reverse, etc). Concerned I'm going to run a red light as I currently have to really focus and check multiple times to make sure my head is ""registering"" what I am seeing. I went to turn on the blinker the other day and questioned myself which direction is used for which signal (left/right). I feel like I have to really focus staying in my lane and sometimes feel like I'm not staying straight. 
5. I use MFA/2FA (where you get a code texted to you that is 6 digits long) and can only remember 2-3 numbers at a time unless it's an easy code (like multiple same numbers in a row). 
6. In general, forgetting some basic stuff that I've been doing for years. (can't think of anything specific at the moment).
7. I can't seem to get started on various projects/hobby's of mine because I can't seem to get my head straight. I simply get overwhelmed and not even start. I'll quit projects halfway through. I'm starting to look like a hoarder at this point, lots of things I want/need to do but just can't get started on them. 
8. I work in IT and I am the only IT person at the company I work for and I've caught myself making more mistakes than normal, and not good mistakes either. 
9. I find ""comfort"" watching the same TV show over & over. The same with movies, I'll rewatch an old movie a hundred times before I'll watch a new movie. 
10. I nearly instantly forget a name when I am introduced to someone and sometimes have to ask multiple times before I remember. Not always, but sometimes. 
11. I'll be asked by someone to do something, but instantly forget a few minutes later. 

I scheduled a doctors appointment which is in about a week and half with my GP. So we shall see, but I am concerned.",1
"And… Back for more advice. My wife (she's 72) was diagnosed with Wericke's Encephalopathy back in November. As all of the contributing factors/symptoms match, I would say it is a pretty solid diagnosis. Her PCP would like us to see a neuropsychologist.

I have gotten tips for QOL/mitigation from insurance/home healthcare/PCP/reading/etc. The (regular) doctors I have talked to so far say she make get better or she may not and no one has a real idea as to why either way. 

So my question is, is a neuropsychologist going to tell me something new/likely be able to do anything or will I be jumping through more insurance hoops to be told Yep, she's got Wericke's Encephalopathy?",1

She has a friend with late dementia and when they talk, her friend may become distressed about her husband or children (deceased and grown up respectively) which has begun to trigger stress and thought disorientation in my grandmother.

The main issue is that my grandmother looks after my uncle who has severe Multiple Sclerosis and can't do most things by himself. I've taken over the morning routine for her to get a break because she can't physically handle it.

I can't be his carer forever - I'm 18 and about to go into 3rd year at university - and neither can she. She doesn't know she forgets things but I know that in a couple of years it will be worse and I want to get any advice for this situation from an outside perspective.",1
"Hi.  Mom is into year 6 of her diagnosis with vascular dementia.  We have been searching for a memory care facility for her for the last two years.  Nothing seems right.  We did find Summer House in California (front porch communities) and it seemed perfect, but they wont take her even though she has sizeable assets.  I guess this facility qualifies based on assets to cover 5 to 7 years of rent with a 10% increase each year.  

This was depressing and I am not interested in signing a financial guarantee.   The cost of care has just gone through the roof as well!

I was reaching out to see if any of you smart memory care veterans out there have identified **'unique facilities'** that manage this patient population?  We fear Mom wont fit in the typical memory care facility.  We are looking in California and AZ.",1
"She has been having word finding and other language issues for about 2 years. Also seeing more problems with basic math and some memory issues. Neurologist diagnosed PPA-lv. He was not sure if it is FTD or AD pathology. He wants to run a PET scan. 

Wife was very upset at the appointment, thought she did not have enough time for the cognitive tests, which is tricky because she has trouble remembering spoken instructions, so not performing well may not fully assess her true cognitive ability, but she had trouble giving her birth date and could not name animals (but could tell carnivores from animals to ride). So I think the dx is probably accurate.

She is only 53, and highly functional with daily stuff (hygiene, dressing, etc. all ok). Still coaches a school science team (increasingly difficult, this will be the last year). Driving has been good, but uses her phone to navigate. She gets confused with tech (remotes, computer searches, etc.). We are finalizing wills and POA soon, but beyond that It is hard to know how to navigate whatever comes next. I have been lurking here for almost a year, and while I am grateful for the insight and resources, I am a bit daunted by what lies ahead.",1
"I have a relative in his late 60s with dementia that has developed incontinence. Bathing has always been a near impossible task with the most we can usually manage being a wipe down of the torso/legs, pants and underwear never coming off. I’m honestly not too sure how often the underwear changed because the relative who was keeping him got super defensive anytime anybody asked something that could be interpreted as doubting their ability to look after him. 

Anyway now he’s having accidents and is apparently wearing adult diapers, but he’s staying in them longer than he should because he won’t let anyone help him change them and he’ll only change it himself when they’re completely soiled. His pants are starting to stink, he won’t take off his coat, and his new caregiver is really struggling on what can be done. He’s not violent yet, but he gets as far away from you as possible and starts shouting/arguing if you try to convince him to remove anything. Any advice?",1
"She woke up feeling confused as in “who am I “ kind of strange feeling today. I thought it maybe a sign of stroke which she had a few years ago. But she had no physical symptoms (no pain, numbness, no speech abnormalities, can answer all basic questions). She has a high blood pressure and has heart condition. Mentally she has been fine (somewhat forgetful at times but nothing major). This sort of feeling strange is something new. She wasn’t sure about taking meds. Her text message to me today contained gibberish characters. She wasn’t sure how to phone her sisters. Is this somewhat common among elders? I have not seen her like this before.",1
"Hi all. So my intellectually disabled beginning dementia family member has been Very manipulative, Very pushy for far too long. This has to do w a wee bit of income from Ssi. Due to delays and mistakes it has taken months and months to try to get his payee appointed, very frustrating. Now that its finally done, turns out there was an alleged overpayment, and a former facility kept money and they r saying he has to pay back

I am trying to fix w help of newly appointed , very busy, inexperienced payee, who has too much on her plate (also very irritating) but it is going to take at least twi months per Ssi. 

I just reached a point two days ago when I found out the bad news, I am too stressed to continue talking w him about this.  I think he is capable of dropping it but it is moreso a pushy ass attitude and inflated ego vs dementia causing most of this behavior. 

Per my last post here, he has been obsessing, being hateful, paranoid, w incessant bitching at everyone about it despite my paying for his things every month over and beyond this lil amount w last trip two days ago. 

Past efforts to try to get him off the ""kick"" have been unsuccessful. 


I told him not to talk to her about it (she is stressed to), and that she did not need to talk to both of us about it, and that I will tell him when it is fixed. Welp, today the phone rings 2 hours later w the same thing telling me I had to call his payee first thing tomorrow. I repeated the above. 

Is that wrong?  There is no redirection ability, he does realize he has been tormenting everyone but according to him that is ok bc ""he is so stressed about it.""  Like his problem is my problem. Which it Is but he makes it 50x worse 

Can I just say, i do not want yo talk about this anymore, I am working on it and will let you know?  He will try to ask questions, but can I just keep repeating that hoping it gets stored away and a boundary will hopefully be set

Thanks for reading. Hope all are well tonight.

Eta update. He called today and maybe it stuck for now Yay.",1
"My husband’s grandma has dementia, she is almost 81, still lives in her home. My husband’s mom is doing everything for her so that is good. For almost a decade, my husband and I have been trying to get her to live with us but she’s fiercely independent. Well now with the dementia, I’m not trying to sound disrespectful, it’s like dealing with an 80yo toddler. She keeps telling us she doesn’t want to be a burden and that it’s not our responsibility. She got the flu at Christmas (she gets it every year) and it nearly literally killed her this time and she gets knocked down a couple notches each time she gets it. She won’t fully recover from it until summer if anything. She used to come to our house a couple times and she had to stay in because of being knocked over by the flu. Because of being cooped up in her house, she is massively massively depressed and thinks she has nothing left to offer the family. Which is horrendously untrue. None of us except my MIL is allowed to go into her house because she’s also a hoarder and is far enough gone that she thinks she can clean it up by herself. We used to be able to go to her house but it’s been like 5 years since we’ve been there. I have offered to help clean out (I’m always chomping at the bit to do that) but she’s too ashamed and embarrassed to have us come in. The whole situation is just a nightmare from every angle possible. But she and my MIL have put a tiny dent into cleaning stuff out. She of course doesn’t know what she has until she comes across it and then doesn’t want to get rid of it. She’s not the filth kind of hoarder, just lots of stuff she doesn’t need. She would just shut down if we forced her to do anything. We haven’t forced anything on her because of that but we’re running out of time. I want to sit and cry thinking about her dying of a broken heart sitting alone in her house. Is there any hope of getting her to move in with us?",1
"My mother is in early Alzheimer's and she has always been a hypochondriac.  She calls/texts me daily about how she feels weak/too tired/can't move.  She has been to multiple doctors and had every test under the sun and is perfectly healthy. The calls come in while I am at work, at 5am, picking up my kids,  etc.  I believe she just wants attention - is feeling lonely.  She has a senior companion coming to stay with her but we are on the 14th person in 6 months and the calls have not stopped or slowed down.  Has anyone dealt with that and what did you do/say?",1
"My grandmother keeps trying to go upstairs. We built her a bedroom and bathroom downstairs, so she has no reason to go up there. Is there any good gates people recommend that can take a budge/messing with? She'd figure out simple baby gates where you pull it up and out so ideally something more sturdy than that?",1
"My mother is 70. Over the past few months (about 15 to 18 months) I began to wonder of she's going senile.

There were a number of weeks where she didn't talk to me. There was no conversation from her.  There were only words - yes, no, good morning, - one word replies to me.

I found her eavesdropping.

She was bored easily.

I began to ties these things together with some other behaviours. She was indecisive when it came to her nephews funeral.  If she would go or not.
She was easily angered.

I could dip back further.  She was overly critical.  Not of me as such but of any repair man that would come to the house.

When I began to wonder, I discovered more behaviour from her.  She had many items of my clothing. Her obsession seems to be with my underwear. Even though its difficult stuff to what she wears and different sizes. She doesn't do my laundry by the way and we keep it separate. She was either getting confused around the home or she was snooping in my room and taking. I think it was the later because I found more stuff she took..

I do think there is something happening with her.  But it's so hard. Every day is different with her.  Sometimes she's ok and then other times she seems to be flat.

There's something I observed. She is awkward with time.

-  if there was a birthday in the family. She keeps a diary and she refers to the diary.  She knows the birthday is approaching. But for every day for a week or so she will say
'we need to text him when it's his birthday'. She would say that several times a day for up to a week.

- there was a funeral last year. It was an open funeral and you can call in at any time between 2 and 7 pm to offer sympathy to the family.   My mother became agitated with me at 2.30.  I thought we had all day and I was getting ready and I was nearly ready to leave but I was not ready. My mother got angry. I discovered she wanted to be there at 2pm and not a minute later.

I have several incidents like this about time where she becomes agitated easily on time. I would be more relaxed on time.

Has anyone else experienced this issue.

I am finding this so hard because I see things are not quite right but it's so early and I don't have a dementia diagnosis and there's no typical symptoms of forgetfulness.",1
"My father is pretty advanced/severe in his dementia, he's been accepted by hospice but is still pretty high energy, anxious half the time and lethargic/low energy the other half. Almost seems like it is constant sundowners some days. 
He was diagnosed 2019ish, and since Thanksgiving has really declined the most. 
My mom is still of sound mind, lives with him at home, and is the primary caregiver, but is very anxious and struggling and not confident enough to make the decisions. It's like she's given up from the overwhelm. I got her permission and hired caregivers, but they're so expensive, we try to only have them in morning and evening. I'm not even POA for them. All my parents want is to not go into a nursing home ever. 
I'm the youngest of three kids. We all love our parents and have had pretty good lives thanks to them, even helping us in our adulthood. I think I've been primary child that has been tracking-caregiving-watching over the parents, helping out with little things, chores, etc for over 2 years now. And you know how you don't notice how it wears on you? 

I think it is time for someone else to take over. I'm the youngest. I only married a couple years ago- and deployed for over a year of that. I want to have babies.  I want to train my dogs to be good, well behaved canine citizens. I want my teenage daughter to have a social life, and parents who are there for her. I want to see my husband more than a few nights a week because not only does work keep me away, but we take turns spending the night at my parents house to help out now 3 nights of the week. I want to visit my parents without the burden of ""did he take his pills, is his diaper clean, what's he eating now?"" 

And now my job is concerned about my performance. I constantly injure my back helping my dad sit or stand or get in or out of bed. This is the first time in my life I have a good job. I am a full time soldier in my states national guard. Passing the military fitness test is important. Not dropping work for appointments or nurses or constant needs constantly is important. 

I never asked to be the primary caretaker. I don't even have POA, one of the older siblings does. I just live the closest, and have always visited regularly. I will have to move for my job at some point. 

I hate going to my parents house. It all hurts. It took years of me telling my siblings how bad it was getting, and they only started listening in January. My Older siblings either have kids in the last few months of high school or no kids. In the past they're indicated they're willing to move in with the parents, yet... don't. 

Since January, they've begun to be more present, and act overwhelmed and ohmygosh wtf do I do and make a big deal. Over things I've specifically explained how to handle. I worked very hard to make sure thry had knowledge and tools and information at hand for helping take care. I literally cannot have a day to myself without some question or demand or declaration about how things are or how they should be, or how they just don't understand this or that thing.

I can't be empathetic anymore. I can't do this anymore, and I don't think my marriage or existing child can take the stress, but I don't think anything short of an ultimatum will make them step up.",1
"Crowdsourcing here because hospice has been super unhelpful. Five days ago, mom was put on 100mg Seroquel/day (50mg morning and evening) to address daily aggression and violence toward her caregivers. Although mom was attacking them due to a delusion that they were preventing me from visiting her, she didn’t really have hallucinations as far as we’re aware and phone calls from me were somewhat effective at calming her. The Seroquel, sedated her and made her harder to understand, but there was a clear reduction in aggression.

Fast forward to last night. She did not sleep. For EIGHT HOURS she screamed and spoke to people who weren’t there, then she began violently attacking/punching her own leg while screaming at it in anger, arguing with it as though it were a person. Nothing could calm her, nothing could stop it. It was relentless, terrifying, and unlike anything we’ve witnessed. 

When I asked hospice about this today, they insisted I needed to give the Seroquel a full two weeks to work, but frankly I’m not sure any of us will survive any more nights like this. Aside from briefly dozing off for about 20 minutes, she’s been awake 36 hours and is largely incoherent. 

I’m strongly considering cutting her Seroquel dose, but hospice has assured me they think this is just her natural Alzheimer’s progression. But my gut says otherwise.

Am I in denial (it’s ok to tell me I am)? Or am I being gaslit by hospice?

Also, we’ve ruled out a UTI. Urine culture was negative.",1
"Last night my grandpa, me and my dad was working on the water pump and my grandpa walked over to a Pontiac fieero thinking it's the water pump then he'll walk over to turn the valve off and he walks in the complete other direction he'll be tellin you a story and my grandpa will say ""I forgot"" at first I thought he was joking but it's hard cause my grandmas having kidney failure and they keep pushing her appointment back and back again sorry if this isn't aloud",1
"I (25/F) should be actively participating in my jobs lunch and learn right now but I'm too anxious and somewhat giddy. My mother (64) was diagnosed with FTD in Dec 2021 and is still VERY capable of cooking, cleaning, eating, talking, and walking. However, she's been home all day, every day since she decided to stop going to work in June 2020. Every day she would just sleep, watch TV, eat, and have her paranoia episodes at night. I've gotten a bit stir-crazy with working from home, going through the obstacles to get the diagnosis, and just trying to enjoy my 20's since March 2020, so It took a LONG time but I finally found an affordable adult daycare program for my mom and today was her first day!

It was a bit of a bumpy start to the day since my mom routinely wakes up at 4 PM and goes to sleep at who knows what time, but I think it was a decent pick-up experience. Transportation to and from the daycare is covered in the cost so I think I just need to get used to the bus pick-up/drop-off schedule. I planned on making my mom breakfast before the bus came to pick her up but the bus driver was 15 minutes earlier than the estimated pick-up time they told me. So, my mom was pushed off to her first day of daycare with no breakfast. However, lunch is provided so she should be fine. 

I feel like a proud mom but it's not my baby, it's my mom, ha! I haven't received any frantic calls from the daycare or my mom so I hope everything is going well so far. Drop-off is after 2 PM so I'll see what my mom says about it when she comes back. I wish I prepared her and myself better for the first day but I'm not going to stress it too much. I know she took her purse with her but I don't even know if she should have brought her purse with her. There are a lot of stray thoughts going through my mind. I don't know what to do with myself now that the house is empty for a couple of hours for the first time in over 2 years but I'll figure it out, ha!",1
"Those are the phrases my sister and hear all the time now.  I'm hoping/doubting there any tricks to get my dad to realize things. Are there? 
My dad is 77,  not sure how far along his dementia has progressed, but it is breaking my heart seeing him like this. He was always such a strong, healthy role model in our lives. And now over the past 3 years especially, he is declining so fast. I'm tearing up just writing this. 
I love him so much, he has done so much for his family, never drank/abused anyone, always led by positive example. Just a great person.  But I keep snapping at him when asks the same questions over and over and over.  I HATE MYSELF for reacting like (yelling, or telling him to ""just go to bed"") to his innocent questions (am I going to work tomorrow? Where's my car/keys?) The big this is his eyes. He thinks he still wears contact lenses.  He had eye surgery 2 years ago and hasn't worn lenses since.  Constantly he's rubbing eyes, showing up with flash light in his hand saying ""look in my eyes, I can't get my contacts out. Can you see them?"" When I humor him and look he says ""your not looking right!"" I'll tell him how he had the surgery and doesn't require lenses, he just says "" I do! I do wear contact lenses"" I see him almost cower back when he sees how irritated I am. 
When I started to research just what/ and how bad dementia is  (Blessed I found this subreddit), I understood it's not his intention to ask so many time but that he CAN'T maintain the memory. He does the same with my sister. (She has taken the role of caregiver, I am kind of ""backup""/after hours as I work a lot of hours/OnCall at my job.) Her remedy: She just to goes to bed early (7pm) and stops acknowledging him.  
     He is still taking care of the personal things like hygiene , using bathroom and preparing small snacks, while my sister has taken over managing the other things in his life: paying bills, preparing meals, managing his meds/appointments.
     Since forced retirement (oct 2022) he hasn't taken up any hobbies, he gets dressed less days per week, and is depressed.  He has never been one to share his feelings, thoughts, opinions or really anything personal or deep, so we never really connected on that ""deep"" level.
      It makes me so depressed seeing him like this. I can't even imagine how he feels. I don't know what to do to make him feel happier.
Probably will need vent further later. Thanks",1
"I sleep in the same room as my grandmother but unfortunately she’s very quiet when she moves around so when she managed to leave the house I didn’t hear her go out of our room. Some guards noticed her outside by the gate of the village and saw that she crawled from a small hole underneath the village gate. She told them she had someone with her but she probably imagined it. 

At 5AM the guards called us up to get her and she had wounds over her hands, elbows and legs from crawling out of the hole. When watched the CCTV from the house we saw she had left home at 2am. 

I feel incredibly guilty from not waking up and if the guards weren’t able to spot her, I don’t know what would’ve happened to her.

There are times where she thinks she’s not home and she says she wants to go back to her childhood home and someone’s picking her up. I’m sure she thought she needed to go home that early morning. 

I’ve attached TONS OF BELLS on every door so if she leaves hopefully it wakes us up. I’m waiting for a burglar alarm system (to alert us if anyone goes in or out of the house while we’re asleep) to arrive as well. 

I have terrible anxiety thinking of what happened and what could’ve happened and I really hope it doesn’t happen again. Do you have any escape stories similar to this? and what did you do to prevent it??? I need advice please!!!!",1
"My great aunt 84 who has dementia and moved in with my family late july has recently started turning her tv up very loud like the top 90's volume and it's stopping us from getting sleep, especially me with my room being right next to hers. 

She has also started turning the landing light off at night and opening the curtains most of the time its multiple times at night after someone closes the curtains.

It's like she thinks its day when it's not and she doesnt even realise the tv is too loud but her hearing is perfectly fine.

We gave her a clock because she asked for one but now even when it's the middle of the day and the sun is bright in the sky she will say goodnight after we finish chatting and she goes into her room. She likes being in her room because it's the only room in the house she can smoke in as nobody else smokes and she chain smokes.",1
"My mom is 67 years old and has always been I know this sounds so mean but a little air headed, growing up we’d always laugh at some of the silly things she’d say but nothing like this.

My dad died 5 years ago suddenly from a stroke.  Since then she has seemed to regress pretty significantly.

She’s pretty overweight and unhealthy but she walks and moves SO slow, like slower than anyone can imagine. Super elderly people move faster than her.  It’s honestly baffling.  I try to move slow and match her pace but physically can not walk that slow.  This is not an exaggeration.  

She talks about her childhood a lot, not in the stereotypical way, but an example is I’ll make something for dinner and it’s mama used to make the best, mama used to do this.  But these are stories she never told until recently.  

More recent events she flat out won’t remember but thinks it’s hilarious.  We will have discussed something pretty important and she won’t remember the discussion a few weeks later 

This one is more random but mainly with animals and babies she’s very bad with using the correct pronoun unless it’s a puppy or dog she’s used to.  Everything is a he.  My dog walks with certain dogs regularly and she interacts with them and will always refer to them as he.  

She will go days and days without leaving the house, but justifies it.  In this same point she makes huge deals of things like showering when she does have something to do as if it’s a huge under taking and makes a plan around it 

I do think she’s depressed but it seems more to it and didn’t know if the two could be linked. 

Thanks in advance",1
"&#x200B;

edit: we are in FL as I know state rules might differ. 

Sorry this might be a bit of a read, Well we aren't technically married but I do plan on marrying my girlfriend, but her father is 65  and a few years ago got diagnosed with vascular dementia. He suffered a pretty brain injury from a fall maybe 10-15 years ago, had a few strokes around 2020 and then was hospitalized, CT scan showed lots of grey matter with diagnosis of vascular dementia. Her mom passed away right before strokes from cancer and she was the one basically taking care of her dad even though she was dying of cancer: medication, food, appointments, finances. So obviously there was a huge hole in their life when she passed in every way possible.Right after her death, he bought a brand new customized Dodge Challenger, a purple mattress and it was then a few months after he had his first stroke. My girlfriend was living there taking care of her parents, then after her mom passed, she basically took care of him and I assisted when I stayed there. To put it short, he could not take care of himself: couldn't manage medications (which might have lead to his stroke with previous cardiovascular history), remember appointments, change his clothes, go to the bathroom, change diaper etc. Not long after, he realized the care needed for himself and agreed to go to assisted living.

Assisted living was the right move, he has the care he needs and management, etc. It was going well until her dad started becoming a problem behaviorally: talking sexually inappropriate things to nurses (one had to transfer out), having police called because he said he wanted his gun from home to shoot someone, even getting banned from ice cream day because of how he publicly treated a worker. He's been seen by neurology and psychology and been evaluated and concerns were brought up then. Lately, he's been taking it out on daughter, demanding her to get out, demanding sodas and snacks. It's gotten so bad that he finished at least two 12 packs of diet soda in about a 5 day span. She doesn't follow on his demands right away, but the constant nagging and even harassment has really affected her health. I've told the nurses about this a few times and they said they'll look into it but I'm sure its not really their job but I had to at least tell someone.

Here is where I would like some advice/input. She currently lives in the house and with her recent health concerns I have moved in. The ASL is of course expensive, they have used all of his savings and he only retired right before he had his stroke. He has medicare and BCBS. She is behind on payments with ASL at the moment and a few months ago, she sold her own car to make up for payments then. She has really worked herself to the core to help her father and it just hurt seeing her have to do that, I don't work at a high paying job and I've helped whenever I can. In the meantime she's been driving his car. She has POA for him. We cannot have him back home, he is a danger to himself and others. He needs to be monitored all the time. Even at the ASL, he falls several times a week. He's supposed to use his walker at all times but still he falls. He's also talked about getting the car back so he can drive around even though he's not in a fit cognitive state and can't control his lower half well. This house was not well financed in regards to the mortgage and there is a bit left on it. Something has to be done. Of course, if she were to ask him if she can sell the car/house he will say no. But we can't get money out of thin air. I know if he loses all of his money or funding he becomes a warden of the state and they take everything of his and probably switch him to a full on nursing home. She is planning on trying to sell the house and car eventually. I know that if he were to qualify for medicaid, they help to pay for nursing homes but from what I see here, that's a long waiting process and not a for sure thing. I had to leave my office job and am trying to get remote work (I'll take any leads), possibly getting a smaller life insurance payout and waiting to hear back from an accident settlement so I don't much money unfortunately. We have no idea where we would move to if the house is sold. I think she will have to find something remote her self maybe and sell the car first. This is all foreign territory and I don't know how I can help.  Thank you so much for reading",1
"I need some advice on whether something is a good idea or if it’s creepy.

My grandad died in December after several years of worsening symptoms and a hellish last three months. Obviously we’re all still getting over it, especially my Nana as they had been together for 78 years and she’s never been alone before.

My quandary is that over the last five years ish, from the point that I was old enough and had enough sense to both realise and accept that I wouldn’t have both grandparents around forever, I occasionally stuck my phones voice memo function on to record while I was visiting them and chatting. They didn’t know I did this, but at the time I thought I’d like to be able to remember their voices in future.

None of the recordings are anything special, grandad never dominated the conversation so there isn’t a massive amount of him speaking, but there is a bit.

I can’t decide whether editing these recordings down and giving my Nana and my Dad a copy is a good idea or if it just looks creepy and weird, or even if it would make things worse.

Does anyone have any opinions?",1
"I observed some behaviours from my mother over the past 15 to 18 months.   I could dip back further into other years too.  The behaviours shows that she is maybe going senile.

&#x200B;

\- The behaviour that got my mind racing at first was observed in November of 2021. Weeks went by and there wasn't any conversation from her. There were some words here and there but there was no conversation. We weren't fighting and I am supportive of her as a daughter.  I am mindful of my own attitude and I help her a lot.  Yet she wasn't talking to me.  I remember one afternoon where she fled the house without saying goodbye. She went for a walk without talking to me. I think there was something bothering her. She was angry at my brother for his behaviour of drinking and possibly drugs and then she was misdirection her anger to me by ignoring me. Even though me and my brother are different people.  I work and I help pay the bills and I bought the groceries many times. He was the polar opposite. He choose to be unemployed and he choose a life of drink and possibly drugs.  I never had a part to play in him being that way.

&#x200B;

The periods of no conversation was the thing that set my mind racing about my mother.

&#x200B;

Other behaviours from her includes:

&#x200B;

\- She has an armchair in the kitchen in front of her TV. She has no spacial awareness at times. She would locate the chair in a way that nobody else had space to sit in the kitchen.

&#x200B;

\- Another time, I was stepping out from the shower and I was finishing in the bathroom.  When I was finished I used the towel I used to mop any wet patches on the floor. As soon as I had the door open, my mother barged in with the mop and she started rubbing the floor.  She was trying to dry the floor.  I had that done with the towel I used.  Her mop was wet and she was unable to get the floor dry and that resulted in an anger and mindless rant to me about the floor being wet.  She was shouting at me as if the bathroom was a public liability and there was someone due in, in any moment to come in and fall and slip.  We were due no visitors by the way. 

&#x200B;

\- she is retirement age now. Everyday is the same for her.  There was a day where she went to town on public transport but there was torrential rain outside.

I always thought that was mindless in that everyday is the same for her and she could have waited for a day til the weather was dry and not raining.

&#x200B;

\- I caught her eavesdropping

&#x200B;

\- then I found items of my underwear amongst her clothes as if they were hers. We are different sizes by the way.   I could understand maybe one or two pieces of underwear getting mixed in but there were many items of my clothing. It seems as if the obsession is with white underwear of mine. She's not interested in anything else as far as I can see.

&#x200B;

There are other little bits too.

&#x200B;

\- like being awkward with time.  We had a funeral to attend to last year and the time was between 2 to 7pm.  It was close by to home. She became antigated by 2.30 pm because I was getting ready.  We had all afternoon to go but I discovered that she wanted to be there for 2.

&#x200B;

\- I found her taking sachets of sugar from a coffee shop and stuffing her pocket with sugars. Even though we have sugar at home and we hardly use sugar. It was just so mindless.

&#x200B;

There is a lot of behaviours listed there. There are other little things here and there kind of similar but I will be all day writing about them.

&#x200B;

I could dip back further into other years to think maybe there was more.  She was easily angered.  I remember an incident where in 2019 we needed a plumber. She didn't want to use a service advertised from a paper. She wanted a recommendation. I got a recommendation for a plumber and his number. I talked to my mother about it and she gave me the go ahead to phone him and book him.  He came to our home and he worked on the jobs we needed done. When he was finished I went for the afternoon.  When I came home my mother was not happy or pleased. For some reason or another. I thought she was being overly critical to be honest because he did do the work that had to be done. She explained that there was something he had to come back to.  My mother was angry at me for booking the plumber and told me not to phone him again. There she was placing 100% of blame on me for booking that plumber even though it was a decision we both agreed on and she gave me the go ahead to it.  It was just so mindless from her.  I was heartbroken because it wasn't a normal anger from her. 

&#x200B;

We had an old and sick dog and she was never able to follow instructions from the vet in the care of the old dog.

&#x200B;

I really think my mother is going senile. Every day is different from her. Sometimes she's OK. Then other times she is not OK.  She does a lot of cleaning and a lot of it is so mindless. There is some weird storage habits too like hoarding but not as bad as deeper hoarders. 

&#x200B;

My question is does old age nonsense and sensible behaviours - does it always lead into a dementia diagnosis?

&#x200B;

Over the past year I joking dementia groups just to learn about it and dementia scares me so much. Its a horrible rotten disease and I don't want to be around that.  I don't know if my mother has dementia or not but definitely I think her mind is slipping in parts but it's not showing up yet as a forgetfulness.  If this turns out to be dementia, I won't be able for this.",1
"My mom had a brain stroke a year back and was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and Vascular dementia - had all classic signs of both. She was evaluated by two neurologists, just to be sure. Her memory and behavior were quite bad.

Now comes the puzzling part - About 3 days back, she had a fall. She didn’t hurt herself. But since then, her memory is quite better. Still some gaps and issues but generally way better. Her behavior is also much more manageable and no agitation.

Any ideas about what is going on?",1
"73-year-old mother living with me has moderate to advanced dementia. Today I wiped her rear end for the first time. She's been struggling with diarrhea off and on, likely due to the statin medication she's been put on for cholesterol, but she will not tell me when it's messy back there so now I have to check regularly. It was pretty bad today so I immediately had her get into the shower and helped her get clean again. Lines I never thought I'd have to cross...

She also picks at her face constantly. She has had the same small wound on her cheek since I moved her in with me three months ago. She picks off every band-aid and I have to replace them frequently, sometimes multiple times a day. This one spot almost nearly healed then one day I saw it was freshly bloodied again and I got so frustrated with her. She truly doesn't know she's doing it and I've tried to find things to keep her hands busy but she persists in scratching and picking away at various spots. She sees them in the mirror and gets upset that she looks like she does, thinking they are bug bites or disease, and the cycle of my frustration begins again. She just doesn't understand. 

It's only been a few months and my complaints seem tame compared to issues others are dealing with but I'm afraid of what the coming months and years will bring. It already feels like too much.",1
"My FIL is in what we think are the middle stages of dementia, and he moved in with us almost a year ago after my MIL passed away. My husband and I both work full time, and I work from home a lot. We have two kids, ages 5 and 9. 

My FIL can still do most things for himself. He can go for walks by himself on our cul-de-sac, he makes himself tea, and will heat up food in the microwave. He prefers to graze constantly instead of eating meals he also has diabetes. When he retired, he never developed any hobbies (I think he was forced to retire due to early dementia, based on some paperwork I found while cleaning out their house). So, his only real hobby is managing his diabetes through walks. He grazes constantly from about 5pm-9pm. 

I struggle with how much to intervene with his food. He kept meticulous records for many years of his blood sugar and diet, and thinks he has a really good handle on what's good/bad for him, but he forgets things, so he'll do things like eat a spoonful of Thai sweet chili sauce right from the container at a rate where the whole thing is gone in a week. If you say anything he'll say ""it's just a little bit.""

I also struggle with some of his habits. He interacts with our 5 year old as if she's about 3, and was constantly poking at her, which she hated. At one point, I said ""do you remember that she tells you she doesn't like that?"" and he said ""yes"", and I asked why he still did it and he said ""it's fun."" He actually stopped after that, so it seemed like something did get through to him.

He remembers some things pretty well. My husband is currently out of town for a week, and several days later he's asking when he's coming back, but he knows where my husband is. 

He was always pretty messy at his home, and he and my MIL relied heavily on cleaning help. We do have someone to help us clean now, but some of his habits drive me crazy. Because he constantly grazes, he'll take a few nuts or some other snack and eat them throughout the house, dropping crumbs everywhere. Or he doesn't want to make too many plates or spoons dirty (and he has his favorites), so he'll rinse used ones off and put them back in a drawer. The plates are usually obviously wet, and the utensils often are dirty with peanut butter or jam and get other utensils and the drawer dirty. I try to thank him excessively if he puts a rinsed plate or utensil on the counter instead of back in the drawer.  

All of my current complaints feel so dumb and petty compared to what I know is coming. I think it can be hard for me to switch from the mode of ""teach even if it's easier to just do it yourself"" for my kids when they leave a mess to ""just do it yourself because teaching is impossible"" with him. It doesn't help that I know he was kind of a jerk to my husband and MIL in the past. Dementia has actually mellowed him out it seems. Sometimes I can manage a good amount of compassion, but other days, it's really hard to. 

I think I get really frustrated when I try to do things for him that he doesn't end up finding helpful. Like, his favorite spoon and fork were ones that our old daycare had given our daughter, so I tried to get other small spoons and forks for him because he would say the others were ""too big"" if I handed them to him, but the new spoons are too short (he says). Or, I'll cook a veggie omelet for him when I make one for myself because I know it was an old favorite (as recently as \~2 years ago) of his that he knew was diabetes approved, and he'll just graze on crackers or cookies that he thinks are ok for his diabetes in moderation instead. 

I'm grateful for this group and an opportunity to just vent a bit.",1
"Calling for all creative solution thinkers

 Dietary Manager here. So the context is in the nursing home dining room: 

 I have a sweet 90 year old resident with dementia that is blind. On his bad days, he gets terribly bored as he cannot see and he quickly forgets where he is/what he's doing/the date and time etc. When he's bored he becomes depressed, lonely, and confused.

 We do offer him music, audio books, pod casts, bubble sensory toys, and as much conversation as we are able to (not much, since we are always cooking, serving, passing snacks, prepping etc). He isn't really a person that makes friends. He is social, but again, dementia limits his ability to hold conversation as he forgets quickly (about every 3 min currently).

 He likes to sit in our dining room (sunny, warm, music). We (dietary team) try to help ease his distress/boredom by offering him different herbal teas, music from our kitchen Alexa, and taste testing. He has his good days but I am trying to come up with ideas that dietary staff can try for his bad days (when music, the bubble sensory toys, etc just aren't helping like they usually do). 

Additional info:
- he worked at an airport for many decades, he can't remember what he did though...
- he likes hot drinks, to be warm
- he likes sweets, he likes all food groups 
- he asks ""will someone please tell me what I'm supposed to be doing?"" 
- he says things like ""I wish I could help"" and ""I'm sorry I can't help"" out of nowhere (this makes me think he needs a sense of purpose behind an activity, even though he is memory is short. Maybe this is why he gets bored with sensory bubble toy). 
- family doesn't have ideas other than music 
- he does see our activities director, but the activities room does not appeal to him, he prefers the dining room

I saw some sensory games with scent cards using spices, I haven't tried them out yet. I also saw giant domino's and I am requesting that we get some in the manager meeting tomorrow. 

Any ideas?",1
"My mothers husband seems to be showing some serious forgetfulness… and I’m curious if this is similar to what would be dementia. He has seen his PCP but they say everything is fine.

His memory has declined so hard over the past 7 years that it is hard to even talk to him. 

You could be having a conversation and he could ask you 5-6 times in 10 minutes how everything is going. And if you said ‘we just talked about that’ his response would be ‘ohhh yeah hahaha that’s right’ 

There are instances where you could pull something out of the oven and a minute later he would try to -without oven mitts- grab the very hot bakeware to move it. 

He has watched the same news episodes recorded on DVR in the morning and afternoon and not really realized it’s the same exact one. 

There are notes written everywhere for him as reminders and my mother has to track his showers because he won’t know when he did last.

These are just a few examples of things that happen, but it is exhausting for my mother (she is almost 70, he is I think 72) to have to watch his every move. 

It feels like talking to a toddler who is trying to learn, but cannot quite grasp or remember.. 

I’m not sure if this is dementia, Alzheimer’s, maybe something else all together.

There’s never a time of day when he’s more ‘on’ it is just always like this, but not how he has always been.",1
Mum is 83 soon. She has advanced dementia but is physically strong. Her brain is shutting down. I’ve seen her regress to about a mental age of 3. She’s medicated so there’s no pain. But she’s hardly there. I’m not coping today.,1
"Hello. I have a grandmother with dementia. She has many pictures of her children and her grandchildren framed and put on bookcases all around her rooms. We usually call each other daily, and almost every evening she talks about those pictures as if they were real people. She says that she tried giving those people (not people but pictures) food, drinks and sometimes even making them coffee. She is usually really confused why don’t they eat - they must be hungry. 

My mother and I try to explain to her the difference between real people and photos of them, she seem to be understanding at the moment, but she ofcourse forgets it later on and feeds them again. It doesn’t bother us of course, but I was interested if maybe someone’s loved one has experienced the same thing and maybe has an explanation why would a person with dementia do that.

 I don’t know if it’s important to note, but she had dementia for over 5 years now. She can almost fully take care of herself on her own without our help. I think she might feel lonely sometimes since she only talks with the family and not her friends. She also lives alone, but we visit her few times a week and speak daily, but I sense she might still feel lonely. Thank you for your answers. :)",1
"My mothers memory has been on a steady slow decline.  She is in assisted living and has acclimated well after a period of disorientation.  She is able to take care of herself inside of a routine and in an environment she is familiar with.  

Yesterday in a conversation on the phone she says to me, guess who I spoke with today, and started to recollect a phone call she had earlier with her grandson.  I couldn’t believe it, as she often forgets she has spoken with someone shortly after hanging up.  Has anyone else seen something like this happen?  I’m wondering if she is “getting better,” but I think I know better.",1
"I can deal with everything caregiving throws, but the paranoia and accusations from my mom that I’m doing anything to harm her. 

We are doing everything to make sure her quality of life is the best we can. This is the one thing that breaks my heart!

"She still knows who I am and loves me. We didn’t have the best relationship growing up (she suffers from depression and bipolar disorder) but I always knew for sure that she cared so much about me.

Now she is sick, she falls and can’t hold her bladder. Sometimes she forgets significant events. I can see everything getting worse and worse.

And I just can’t be with her or else I’ll be messed up for weeks afterward. The last time I saw her, she was so frail and childlike that afterwards I was messed up for weeks. When I was with her, I could barely look her in the eyes because if I really paid attention I’d just start crying. 

I had nightmares after seeing her and just curled up and in bed if I wasn’t working. She has a full time caretaker and family nearby. My brother seems to do well with distancing himself from his emotions when it comes to her, even when she says awful things to him, so he’s able to be around her more often. 

I don’t get what’s wrong with me. I get it - it isn’t about me, it’s about her, she is the one suffering. Hopefully someone can relate and won’t just see me as a terrible or weak person.",1
"She was beautiful and shining and there

In a house crafted from love and sweat

The halls she scrubbed with a tooth brush

Her collection of designer shoes

What do we do when one day someone leaves for good

And not in a brilliant ray of light, not with thunderous applause, not with comfort or serenity or peace

But in the depths of depravity, mind frayed and broken into vanishing fragments

Everything you are, everything you were distorting, bleeding into each other until you can't remember anything

And the days pass like they never started, never ended

I miss you, I miss every part of you that was stripped of you

I'm sorry I never went to see you, I was afraid

I'm more afraid now of what you saw in your fever-like state, if you were alone, if you were terrified, if you ever could comprehend anything besides pain and sadness

I miss you, I miss your kindness, I miss your laughter

I don't remember when I started never hearing it again

We never are aware of the transition until its over",1

"

No official diagnosis yet but we're pretty sure it's  Alzheimers or possibly vascular dementia from hospital brain scans recently. She has been growing very combative, doesn't sleep, and is at an extremely high risk of falling and refuses to use her walker. I've probably spent >200 hours this month taking care of her so far and my mom is spent as well. She also hits me from time to time when I don't let her do dangerous things which ,lol, doesn't hurt me as a tall guy but still.

 Does anyone have any tips to help her sleep and be more receptive to care? Medication etc? We would prefer to not put her in memory care right now but as caregivers we are burned out.",1
"My mother did not deserve to go out like this. The thing she feared the most took hold in the middle of a fucking pandemic. The first one we have had in a hundred years.

  A woman who has dedicated her life to making other people  happy and feeling loved will spend her last years afraid, paranoid, and feeling unloved/lost. It absolutely breaks me that she thinks her family has abandoned her because she does not recognize her husband of 54 years and her daughter who would give her life to ease her pain for one moment. We are the very same people this disease has made her think have left her. We are with her every day and night praying she finds comfort. 

That is a heartbreak I will never get over   I cry for the the family I once had, the future I once saw, my father’s broken heart, and the past she will never remember.  Fuck you Alzheimer’s .",1
"My 92YO mom lives with us and has hospice care for cardiac issues.  Most of the time she does okay, but she's beginning to exhibit some mild dementia, like not remembering instructions, etc.  All in all, it's not too bad considering some of the posts on here, but it's still very hard to handle because our care options are limited.  And in spite of having hospice, her passing is not imminent--she could live a couple of years longer.

Anyway, I have noticed increasing signs of sundowning.  For instance, fretting over things, such as thinking someone else is in the house, am I going to forget to give her the evening meds, rummaging through her things, fretting over finances, etc.  She even pries into my personal finances, which upsets me bc my reaction is that it's none of her business and she's got nothing to worry about.

Does anyone have any tips for dealing with this?  Hospice has given her a prescription for generic Ativan but I don't like how she reacts to it.  She has the smallest dose but it ***really*** sedates her to the point I have to help her dress or walk, which increases my work.  Any other suggestions?

**EDIT**:  Thanks to all who commented.  I'm sorry I haven't been able to respond but my husband was attending a CME all weekend so I was prime caretaker.  I will try as many suggestions as possible in our situation.  We have many restrictions as she have very limited vision due to macular degeneration and also limited mobility.

I did have a good visit with the hospice physician yesterday afternoon, and she explained more about the ativan.  I have adjusted when I give her the one dose and she has responded well.  Also, when I described her symptoms/behaviors, the doctor said she probably has only a year or two left.  She mentioned that when the symptoms appear later in life, the progression is usually quicker, and she's weakening now--holding her glass with both hands, having trouble feeding herself, sleeping for longer.  And these signs only started around the holidays and have progressed quickly.

In some ways I feel guilty that I'm not too sad.  But my dad has passed and my mom is ready to be with him.  She has expressed some suicidal ideation, if she had the physical ability and means, so she's ready, and I have to say I am too.",1
"Hi everyone,

I'm an overnight staff for a community living arrangement/assisted living household with several clients. One of the clients living in the household has been diagnosed with Alzheimers and has had other assorted diagnoses over the course of his life. He's in his 70s, and is very difficult to understand when he speaks, and requires one to one attention during his ADLs and other hygiene related processes.

He has been struggling greatly with his clothes recently, either not recognizing old favorites or just dismissing the clothes as ""not his"" or, during a bad day, ""disgusting"" clothes. Quotes are words he says frequently. Occasionally staff can remind him that his clothing has been freshly washed (as it is, every day) and we use scented detergent so it smells good. On good days, that works. On bad days, staff will frequently go through every shirt or pair of pants he owns until he finds something he says yes to. At night, I don't actually care if he chooses to sleep mostly naked. The problem comes in the morning, when he's up and in the main areas of the house with his housemates, all of whom have their own various diagnoses, and have equal share in the house. Due to preserving his dignity and the dignity of his housemates, he cannot be allowed to just walk around naked so extra effort is gone into finding him clothing he is comfortable with. This often results in him choosing some clothes, then deciding part way through the morning that he hates what he's wearing, and trying to tear it off his body. If he takes off the item of clothing and staff is unaware, he will either try to do one of three things: 1, sneak into the bathroom and flush it, 2, sneak into the bathroom and throw it out in the garbage, or 3, open his window and yeet it into the yard. 

He's done the 3rd so many times that he has alarms on his windows for his own safety. The 1st, we make every attempt to stop him safely for the good of the toilet and household, and the 2nd, we just let him throw the item away then retrieve it once he has exited the bathroom. 

Color, fabric type and scent are arbitrarily chosen by day, though all of his pants are elastic due to mobile acuity being reduced and he's not able to unbutton jeans any longer. Any ideas as what we can do as a staff and household to help him with his clothing? Has anyone else experienced this?",1

"Started noticing some things about my wife for last couple of years. We are in mid 50s. She was never been great at learning new things (and doesn’t have much ambition to) and technology doesn’t come naturally her. In past, I most likely written off some of her behavior based on that if that makes sense.

She was been wanting to drive at night less, which isn’t uncommon I am sure, and I didn’t think much about it. I few years ago, she had to drive downtown to visit our son, I had other plans, and she hit a trash can that was in the street. That upset her, but she would still drive during day to do shopping, which is all nearby. Last summer, we helped move one of our children about 200 miles away and needed her to drive one of the cars. It was a nightmare. I was following in moving truck and watched as she couldn’t follow the lead car in slow lane. She was all over the road, we stopped 4 times in 30 miles before we gave up, left a car somewhere safe. She had no idea what she was doing. I had no idea how bad it was.

That was last August, and it has been slow getting answers and plan. We first got in for eye appointment, and said something else is going on. He did some minor cognitive tests, and she did pretty bad. Next, we got into our primary care doctor and he need some cognitive tests, and said she scored about as low as allowed. Referred to Neurologist, which took a while to get in. EEG, MRI look good. Neurologist after a few minutes said dementia, which was the first time that came up. He wanted her to see a clinical neurologist for in-depth cognitive testing to help pinpoint and last November she spent 6 hours with him. It took a month for a follow up with him and he basically summarized that the results were so bad he doesn’t think they are valid

We have been in a holding pain since.  The Neurologist we saw once for 30 mins still hasn’t seen the complete report from the clinical neurologist. A friend of a friend is a retired neurologist and recommended a mind clinic about 90 mins away. Our primary care doctor  referred us in January, but the first they can see us is May. I am so frustrated trying to get answers.

There is definitely a vision component to what is going on. And, short term memory vs long-term.

Sorry to rant here, and terrified about what is in front  of us.",1
"I’ve tried everything. About 3 weeks ago, my mom (73), suddenly became fixated the idea that her caregivers are, by being in her home, preventing me (her only child, who lives in NYC) from coming to see her. For context, I’m with her two weeks out of every month, though mom has no recollection and believes it’s been many years.

This belief has resulted in 24/7 violence against her caregivers — hitting, shoving, screaming, attempting to stab with utensils, ramming them with her walker, and locking them out of the house even in the middle of the night. No amount of phone calls or FaceTime help, as she’s essentially convinced I’m a deep fake and not her real daughter. She even tried to hit me through FaceTime.

I’ve been unable to fly down because I’ve had significant medical issues requiring surgery and recovery during this time, and I’m already scheduled to take FMLA to come for a month starting next Friday to transition her to memory care as I know she won’t be able to maintain with in-home caregivers.

So, desperate for a solution until my arrival (mom is a borderline and was highly fixated on me even before Alzheimer’s), we added Seroquel to her meds four days ago and it instantly made a world of difference.

But, starting last night, mom began refusing her meds. We let it slide then as advised by hospice, but this morning she was even MORE adamant about not taking them, declaring that they were causing her physical pain (ironically, she doesn’t realize the physical pain is from refusing her pain meds for her multiple myeloma) and that I was trying to “have (her) killed.”

We tried every tactic, from calls, to explaining we “took out the pills that were hurting (her)” to the applesauce and pudding tricks (refused both). Nothing is working. And the longer she’s off Seroquel, the more violent her resistance becomes.

I’m at a loss. Since I can’t make it down until Friday, my husband is flying down on Sunday to relieve the caregivers. But if she still refuses to take meds from him, I know the only place mom can go is a geriatric psych ward. I’m devastated, but I don’t know what else to do.

Has anyone else faced this situation? If so, how did your LO do in/with geriatric psych? Is she doomed to spend the rest of her days there if she continues to refuse pills?",1
"Hi there,

To be honest I’m not sure if anyone can be of much help, just in that these things are unfortunately awful and there aren’t any easy avenues, but if anyone has some advice I’d be grateful. 

My grandmother was diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia nearly 2 years ago. She lives in a specialist facility who take great care of her, despite her increasingly difficult behaviour. Different members of my family visit her regularly, including my parents twice a week, and have done so since she was diagnosed. 

Recently she’s taken a turn for the worse, and her paranoia has extended to her relationships with her close family members. In her mind everyone hates her, are cruel and don’t care about her at all. Now I completely understand this is the awful nature of what she’s going through, and I feel so sorry for her that she feels that way when she has such a loving family around her. I have noticed how much this new turn in attitude is starting to affecting my parents however, who are caught between visiting her to be shouted at and told they don’t love her, and leaving her alone without visitors. 

This isn’t a medical advise question really, but more a call out to ask if any loved ones have any suggestions to help deal with this really. Whether you’ve been able to get through even a little bit to your loved one, or just how you’ve dealt with it at large. 

Thank you so much.",1
"My mother is in her late 60s and over the last several years has begun to show a pattern of paranoia about many things - nuclear war, QAnon type stuff, etc. - but especially the idea that there are men sneaking around her house at night. 

She lives alone, but the house she lives in is my old house, and it's in literally one of the safest neighborhoods you could ever ask for. The entire time I lived there, absolutely no disturbances of any kind. It's close to an elementary school and has lots of foot traffic from children walking to and from school. 

She has cameras *everywhere* but somehow can never produce an image of this man/men. There's always an excuse why the cameras didn't catch anything... ""They weren't working"" or ""my power was out"" or ""the camera timed out"" (not possible) or ""the intruders are avoiding cameras."" I installed a camera under my own control in her back yard, one I've used myself (not just the model, but THAT camera) for many years, and even when she says someone is banging on her back door loudly for long periods of time, the cameras never pick up even motion. The camera is super reliable, even at night, and I just can't believe her explanations any more - partly because they make no sense from a technology perspective.

I also called the police department to get their list of interactions with her, and it's not great... She's called them several times, and nothing has ever been substantiated. She's claimed that there was a suspicious vehicle in her driveway... Cops show up, no one there. She claimed that someone was using a metal detector and digging in her back yard to search for precious metals (?) ... needless to say, no one there. Although they didn't say this, they now (after many calls over several years) seem to be treating her as a ""nuisance caller"", of which they have many. 

At this point I'm increasingly sure that she is either lying *very boldly* for attention, or that she's starting to develop a mental issue. I'm really worried she's going to hurt herself or someone else (she has guns) and I'm at the end of my rope getting calls and texts from her all the time where she claims something is going on and I *know* she's lying about at least some of the things she says. 

She's not just talking about these things; her house looks like a bunker, inside and out, as she continues to add cameras and preps for the coming QAnon Storm/""Ten Days of Darkness""/nuclear war/EMP attack/power grid shutdown. Every time I visit lately, the house is filled with the drone of her (very loud, very expensive) industrial food dehydrator. She has tried multiple times to convince me that I need to move out of my downtown home because of various extremely dubious scenarios she thinks are imminent. 

So... What do I do? I'm 100% certain that she'll resist any effort I make to encourage mental health treatment... Do I just have to wait for something bad enough to happen that she legally has to get help?",1

Had a small stroke about 3 months ago, and started seeing hallucinations a few weeks after he was home. Found he has liver disease and blockages in the neck and brain. After another episode, he has the diagnosis. 

Seems to be going quickly. With brain shrinkage and caverns instead of wrinkles. I’m planning to take care of him on discharge. He is still there in the brain and knows where he is and who we are, but his short term Memory is gone just about. 

Advice on life expectancy, care, or help?",1
"My mom has been taking care of my grandma her entire life. My grandma broke her foot about half a year ago and has started to show signs of dementia ever since. It has now come to a point where my family is being kept up at night due to constant screaming and my mom has stopped working to take care of her full time.

It is now too much on her and my family. I no longer live at home but I’m doing whatever I can to help. I’m trying to find a place to send my grandma but it’s so hard, especially due to to my lack of knowledge and the family’s lack of financial resources. My grandma has Medicare/Medical but most places I call are either full or don’t accept the insurance (we are in California).

The doctor says she needs to be admitted into a hospital before being sent somewhere. That sounds crazy to me. 

I feel so bad for my family, especially my mom. I’d do anything to get them help.

I’ll take any advice I can get. Thank you!",1
"I don't know if this is the right location to post this, but my grandfather was recently hospitalized and has been generally confused for about 2 months,  he has a few sisters that I'm trying to find as my brother, sister, and I are his only other family, he's 77 and we never really got to know any of his family, our mom did but she has been passed for some time now.

We aren't entirely sure if it's a form of dementia yet, he's still being tested at the hospital but it's so scary to me that he doesn't even recognize me. We went through his phone to see if we could find his sisters number but he has no contacts saved at all. We're located in columbus, ohio would anyone be able to point me in the right direction to possibly tracking down the rest of my grandpas family?",1
"It’s me again. I started my day with texts at 6am from my dad telling me to call my mom and tell her she’s home since she’s insisting the house was bought by a girl and she’s not allowed to stay there any more and has been trying to escape. 

A few hours later my Dad calls me and says he’s had a little bump into a guardrail with Mom and the aid in the car on the way back from Walmart. I go to pick them up and discover the car is most likely totaled, though Dad insists he was going very slow. Dad has no memory issues, but I mentioned here before he’s schizophrenic and bipolar and has a drinking problem he thinks I don’t know about. He’s been so stubborn about giving up driving well now he has no choice. Then he tells me he’ll just keep the car parked in the driveway from now on. Umm no sir you will not. The police officer at the scene was kind enough to just give my dad a warning this time. But part of me wishes he wasn’t. 

Anyway, so during all this, my mom went to the bathroom in her pants. So if I had any question before if she’s reached that stage yet I think I know now. When we pulled up to their house she was very surprised and asked me if I bought this house. So I just played along and said yes yes I did and you can stay here. The aid then whisked her off to clean her up. I think I am “the girl” now, meaning my mom doesn’t know I’m her daughter any more. 

At this point I told my dad this is why we can’t keep going like this. He has been fighting me on moving into a home. Tomorrow I plan to bring them both to tour a facility and hopefully get them moved in ASAP. Their funds should last two years there. Two years of knowing my mom is safe and my dad can’t control things any more sounds like heaven to me. 

Does anyone have any advice for me to make this transition go smoothly? Anything I should bring with me tomorrow other than their ID and insurance cards? I will have to consult their lawyer about how to handle their finances for future Medicaid application. (They aren’t married)",1
"Sadly, the moment I was dreading is almost here. My grandma of 97 (2 years of dementia) is dying.
She can't move anymore, barely eats, barely can speak or recognize anyone except me and last night, for the first time, she needed oxygen tank.
I've been preparing for this moment for almost two years now, but I am still feeling terrible.
Since they called me and told me she needed oxygen, I feel like I want to cry non-stop, can't focus on anything.

I am alone so I will handle the arrangements, but I feel so, so sad.",1
"One minute she says she hates her house she is in now then the next she loves it. I was thinking about a little lie and say that the house is getting new heating so it's best to stay in New property till done. She has vascular dementia, has sundown syndrome, has been found wandering at night and has had 2 very bad falls. It's not safe for her to live on her own. She has always been very stubborn and nothing ever pleases her. I don't know what on earth to do. I am turning to alcohol to help with all the stress. I so want to be her daughter again and not her carer. Thanks for reading and letting my have a little rant",1
"for context, my grandpa passed away about 6 weeks ago and my grandma has needed reminders about him passing away and is always very very distraught about it. she never talks about it with me, I think she's trying not to upset me, but always with my mom, the care nurses or her other friend.

recently it was her birthday and my uncle brought an urn and a candle with his obituary printed on it, and my grandma keeps it on her nightstand. even more recently, say, yesterday, they changed what kind of meds she's on and she's gotten so so much worse.

yesterday she called my mom and asked if she had heard from grandpa, since she had been trying to call her old phone number. she now believes when they left for the nursing home, that they had fought and she came alone. 
she now calls several times per day and asks if my mom has heard from him. in the past, she was able to look over at the urn and be reminded of it and calm down quickly, but now she's almost angry when asking about it.

about an hour ago she had called my mom asking where he was again, and when she explained it, my grandma got angry and had asked why she wasn't told and why nobody came over to tell her, to the point where she was so upset that a nurse had to come in and get her off the phone. she had said ""i just found out my husband died""

I don't know how my mom would be able to tell her in a way that wouldn't upset her, and I'm terrified that with the new change in meds that this is going to happen more often. I'm not sure what to do, especially since it's not me talking to her. I assume she doesn't want to talk about it with me since I'm too young and it would upset me. 

before you would be able to explain it to her and carry on with the conversation, but now it's so much worse for her. thank you in advance for your responses",1
"My mother had stroke exactly a year back and has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and Vascular dementia. She had memory, anger and trust issues from couple of years even before the brain stroke. Right now she can walk with some difficulty , use bathroom and eat by herself. But she doesn’t want to go out anywhere or talk to anyone on phone. She doesn’t take any interest in almost anything - sometimes pays a little attention to music or news. At times she sleeps for days with bathroom breaks and food breaks. Some days, she is very hungry eating 3-4 times of normal diet and some days, she eats almost nothing . And yes, the days she doesn’t sleep much are the most difficult days, she hallucinates - talks to imaginary people and screams. She accuses me, her only son willing to take care of her, of stealing and not providing for her enough.",1
"This is just venting because it’s so emotional to endure. My grandmother is 89 years old and has had dementia since 2015. She lived alone from 2014 until 2017, when she was found half naked wandering a golf course at 3am. She’s been in a care facility full-time ever since. Up until about a year ago, she was generally doing okay. We would talk, and she would generally remember me, just not specific things. She remembered everything up until the onset of her dementia, and was stuck in time. 

But the last 3 months have been incredibly tough and it happened so fast. She stopped showering, and has to have assistance from the care takers. She struggles with incontinence, and doesn’t realize it, so she doesn’t change her clothes. She has completely stopped talking. Every week, we have one family dinner night with my entire family. She just sits on the couch in a fetal position and doesn’t speak. I feel like the onset was so slow at first, but now it’s happening all at once. I’m worried that this is the final approach to the end. It’s been 8 years since the onset. Now it feels like the end. 

I’m sad. It’s so hard seeing a loved one go through this. I hate seeing her like this, because I know it’s not her. I just needed to vent to someone who understands.",1
"Edit: just discovered my dad who is on 4 psych meds that all say may cause drowsiness and disorientation when mixed with alcohol is indeed drinking alcohol again. I really don’t know what to do any more. 


My parents have a live in aid and a night time aid because Mom no longer sleeps. It costs $3300 a week. Their income is $8k a month so they’re using up savings. And they still need me far more than I can continue to help. There’s no other family around. I live a half hour away and have to go there all the time to check on them, take them to appointments, etc. I can’t keep doing this I had to quit my job, my kids are missing out on things, I’m short tempered now from stress and miserable. I can’t be the mom I need to be AND continue like this. I had a hard childhood and have so much resentment that I have to use all my energy to separate from to do what I need to take care of my parents. At this point I have provided more care for my dad than he ever did for me growing up. I have POA for both. They are not married, their home is mom’s name only. 

Dad is 64with bipolar and schizophrenia who needs help almost as much as Mom (75) with dementia, but is oblivious to that fact and thinks he can take care of her when he has made it painfully obvious that he can not. I suspect he’s also been an alcoholic my whole life but hid it, he didn’t live with us most of my childhood and God only knows why my mom let him back in our lives when I was a teenager. Recently I found dad wandering outside in the freezing cold and catatonic. He’s been hospitalized 5 times since 2020 because he won’t take his medication. Each time my mom gets worse and worse. It’s horrible. I have no idea how much time she has left, but the idea of her suffering like this for years on end breaks my heart. 

She doesn’t sleep at night, can’t find the bathroom in her own home, has wandered out of the house twice even with my dad and an aid there. I have installed cameras and alarms now. She can barely get from sitting to standing without help. She sits ALL day long and does NOTHING. Not even watch tv. She says the people don’t make sense. Sometimes she talks jibberish. She thinks my dad is her dad. Her dad died almost 30 years ago. She imagines she is trapped somewhere and has to escape. She wears depends now after trying to use the toilet with her pants still up. Any time I have to take my dad somewhere she cries and says don’t leave me. How much longer is she going to suffer like this??? Two years ago she had zero outward signs of dementia! 

I toured assisted living near me and it would be perfect. But it’s $14500 a month! If we do this, they will burn through their savings in 1.5 years, then what?? No facilities near me take Medicaid. Ok so say we sell their house, that could possibly buy them 3 more years. Then Dad will have no home to go back to. I just don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I was shocked to learn that my mother doesn’t even have life insurance never mind long term care insurance. Oh and the icing on the cake is that my dad refuses to stop giving money to charity. I even had to move their mail to a P.O. Box. He uses his phone to do it now. I’d be alarmed but this isn’t new, it’s part of his mental illness and he will not stop and he lies to me about it like how he lies about taking his meds until he gets sent to the hospital again. I can’t do this any more.",1
"This is my first time posting here but have really enjoyed reading and seeing everyone's advice. I'll try to make this short and to the point.

Mom is only 68 and in great physical health, but early onset dementia really took hold about 2 years ago. My partner and I had been living in the Midwest helping her along since my father's passing a few years prior, and she seemed fine... until we got job opportunities and had to relocate to Nevada. Within 2 weeks of us leaving and moving across the country, things really went south... she was no longer able to live alone - not cooking for herself, not paying bills, missing appointments, misplacing her dentures, went into a depression, not taking any of her meds at all... etc. After the monumental task of getting her affairs in order, house sold, etc, we relocated her here to Las Vegas where she now lives with us full time.

She's in a really weird spot as far as her dementia is concerned. She's too bad to live alone, but not nearly bad enough to go to a full-fledged nursing home. She doesn't have quite enough money to pay out of pocket for a luxurious assisted living situation, but has more than enough to bring in caregiver 2-3 times a week to help her out in our home. For the past 15 months, I've avoided hiring a caregiver... procrastinated is really a better word for it... because honestly I am very overwhelmed and don't even know where to begin with it. I've continually put it off just saying things are fine as they are. Except now they're not. The inability to do things without my mother in tow is taking its toll on our work, and to be quite honest even our relationship in some ways.

It's getting to the point where we're needing someone as an outside caregiver. My work from home job now requires regular travel, and my partner's hybrid corporate job isn't really flexible enough for him to work from home the entire times when I'm away. We don't have time to ourselves anymore.

She's good by herself for 2-3 hours at a time, but anything longer than that and she forgets where she is, forgets where we have gone, and starts getting confused/inventing things. One day we went out to lunch and to the grocery store (and left her at home), and returned home about two and half hours later to find her bedroom completely ransacked with things piled into suitcases and photos taken off the walls..... she had got it in her head that we were moving that day and had it in her head that she needed to have her things packed by the time we got back.

I have a [Care.com](https://Care.com) account but haven't actively searched on there... yet... part of the reason being that I don't feel like I really even know what I am looking for!?! I guess at the core of things... I hate to put it this way... but I'm really needing like an adult babysitter. She doesn't need someone to change a bedpan or bathe her, but more so to hang out and do memory exercises with her... remind her to take her meds... take her out to socialize or help her organize her room, keep her engaged. Keep an eye on her and keep her on track as to what is going on.

I guess my main sticking point with moving forward is not knowing how much this is going to help us or how effective it will be... so my main question is... if anyone has had success hiring a caregiver in a similar situation... to give you a little more time to work, breathe, relax, and bring a little balance back to your life? Can a good caregiver situation really allow her to successfully live with us... without breaking the bank... and keep the need for institutional care at bay?

And are there other places besides [Care.com](https://Care.com) that I should be looking? Is it weird for me to be looking for someone that can work on a set schedule a couple times a week but also be on call in case of a travel week or something unexpected pops up that we can't do with Mom? What are some important criteria to look for in dementia care, or red flags to watch for?

Very overwhelmed. I guess after all these months it's just finally catching up with me. Help. Lol.",1
"Hello everyone, my mom is a wanderer and she has 24 hour care but the caregivers have noticed that she will attempt escapes when they are in the bathroom, we are looking to get a door security system that alerts you when the door is opened. Maybe something with a key pad to type in a code..? She lives in low income housing so it can’t be anything too elaborate. 

Any recommendations?",1
"Hi! I've posted a lot in here but I'm a 28 yr old female working full-time from home and also being a full-time caregiver to my 86 year old grandma with dementia, congestive heart failure, hip degeneration, etc. We've gotten into a routine here, but her hip has been causing us a tremendous amount of problems and I just don't know what to do. We have two major safety issues and I am at a loss. Firstly, her providers want us to have her up and moving and walking as much as possible so she doesn't lose more mobility, but it's a safety issue. She uses a two-wheel walker, which thankfully she was doing before the dementia worsened so she used to understand that. But shes not steering or using it right sometimes or outright standing there, not moving. Secondly, she cant remember to use a bedside commode at night for her safety. 

When I get her up from her chair to take her to the bathroom or to help her to bed,etc she needs quite a bit of assistance. I help her balance while she gets up. Today we were headed for bed she stopped walking which is normal. Her speech therapist advised me that when this happens to give her a second and then remind her where we're headed. So I was reminding her when all of a sudden she was falling. I caught her and took all her weight. She started trying to sit down and bend her knees while I was holding her up. I asked her several times to try and stand up, but she didn't seem to understand me. I held her there for a few minutes and then pushed her up and got her upright. She then tried to push her walker forward without moving her feet forward so I grabbed her again.  She said she felt bad, but then kept moving. Once we got to her bedroom she did fine, laid herself down like nothing happened. 

Luckily she doesn't weigh much and I'm a bigger person so I could hold her up. She's not able to tell me when she's hurting, feeling bad, etc. I've been caring full-time for her for only 2 months so I'm trying to learn her non-verbal queues but struggling. It's so hard to tell whether she's in pain from her hip, or just confused when we have these episodes with her walking. We have a wheelchair for her, but I normally keep it in my car and encourage her to walk as much as possible at my house. But I'm not sure that's what is best anymore. My home layout is NOT ideal for a wheelchair, and the doorways cannot accommodate one. I can't afford renovations (we're really struggling as we're paying out of pocket ourselves for her stuff while we figure her finances with a lawyer). I'm scared that depending on the wheelchair where we can will cause her to go downhill quicker, or that if we don't use it she's in pain. it feels like neither is the right answer and I'll be doing the wrong thing either way.. Even if I do figure out what to do, that brings me to the next issue. Overnights. 

When she first moved in, she was on a bad diet and was having accidents all night. Since she can't use a call button, I set up a motion alert camera to wake me up when she was up to use the restroom. So every 2 hours, I would be woken up and would hustle downstairs and meet her in the restroom. Now that we have her diet regulated, she's having less accidents that require immediate clean up. I still monitor her on camera all night, but don't get up and rush downstairs anymore. But now that her mobility is going I don't know what to do. 

I sleep with a C-pap and my stairs are steep. So when her alert goes off, it takes me a few minutes to get downstairs. By the time I get downstairs, she's already halfway to the bathroom. I've gotten her a bedside commode, but she doesn't pay it any mind. I've tried notes reminding her to use it, I've tried a motion activated voice recording telling her to use it. I just don't know what to do. 

When she moved in and I was up with her every few hours, I was miserable. I have to be up at 9PM and 9AM for her pills. Then I work from 9AM-6PM while also caring for her through that time. I usually can't get her to bed till 10PM and I usually try and get something done before bed. So I'm in bed by 11:30PM. If I had to start getting up with her again, I just don't know how I'd get any sleep at all. I was getting 3 hours or less every night. 

So my hope is that someone may have an idea I haven't tried with her bedside commode. Or even suggestions on her mobility issues that we've had increased. We can't afford any help in the home, and she doesn't qualify for Medicaid right now. Nor can she afford to be private pay at a care facility. So we're really in a tough spot, and I'm really her only option. Her lawyer wants a 5k retainer to help us sort her finances and get her applied for Medicaid, and were trying to save money to do this.  Her speech therapist let me know that based on her fast decline, in less than a year she may not be able to communicate at all and that I may not be able to care for her at home anyways. So I know we're going to have to figure something out, but for now we're stuck.",1
"My father often takes care of my grandfather (his father in law). As I am off at college I am hardly present but call my grandparents as often as possible.

My grandfather has never been the same since he fell and hit his head which caused a traumatic brain injury with brain bleeding. He is still capable of living mostly independently in their one story house, we have arranged the house to be easily navigable with railing and ready access to walkers and other resources. Both my grandparents have us on speed dial at any time and they call us whenever they need their shopping done or anything else.

Papa (my grandfather) used to serve in the military as a Lt. colonel and also got involved in business minded ventures during his time growing up in the Bronx working at the family Deli and later being involved in stocks, these habits have followed him all the way. These habits have led to him being more urgent and snappy with getting things done but also led to an increased degree of worry he feels for various matters.


My father who means well has always struggled with temper/anger issues and his very high blood pressure which he takes medication for still likely does not help with that.

My grandfather has some consistently appearing concerns and obsessions about specific issues:

Taking the compost out weekly. He insists we hire a crew to take the compost out each month but there's not enough compost to warrant this.

He has a concern about the septic tank being full or having issues and has on his own time called their septic company about issues that don't exist with it. He keeps talking to my father, concerned that there is an issue with the sceptic tank regardless of assurance of it being functional.

He's well on his way to his 90s. Despite the fall he has been otherwise physically healthy for someone his age. His years in the Air Force have long since ended but now he believes that they still owe him some form of pension/unemployment that they promised and he says he is still waiting for them to get back to him.

He is also always insistent on coming over to help him tend the garden, mow the lawn, and do general labor even if it was already done some time recently.

My grandfather always insists on being right, as he's always been headstrong. At this rate it's become increasingly noticable. Even if you reassure him something isn't needed or something doesn't need to be done, he still insists and will argue it with my dad. This where the biggest issue begins. I think my dad has a deep set issue with people arguing or disagreeing with him and I don't know what to do. Everything adds up onto him to apparently just make him more frustrated. It got Sinbad that one time they argued and my grandfather told my dad to ""go to hell.""

Although I am no expert, I have volunteered at retirement homes and helped people in similar, if not worse situations. How do I convey to my dad that he has to be patient with my grandfather. I try to tell him that he isn't in the right mind and that he should really be much more patient and not take things so personally or to at least take it in a way that doesn't annoy him. It seems so unacceptable to be the way he is to my grandfather who isn't quite the man he used to be but I don't know what to do.

My dad means well and truly cares about them but it's like he has this monster inside of him that just grinds gears with other people and pops. It honestly makes me angry and sad but I don't know what to do because someone who seems to have a tough time understanding how to care for someone struggling with their mental health. I have honestly considered talking to my dad and asking him how he felt if he was in a degrading state of mind and I treated him like he treated my grandfather.

I'm sorry if this is incoherent, I'm just really emotional right now and on the verge of crying. If any clarification is needed, please ask.",1
"I feel like I have a somewhat weird situation and I’m not sure what to do.  I’m not close with my father ever since he left when I was 15 (currently 29, F). He lives in NY with my step mom and has close contact with her entire family it seems (can’t exactly confirm but that’s what I’m gathering)
I sort of knew he had something going on, for the past few years it’s been next to impossible to get in contact with him directly, and I noticed on my Christmas gift check that they send every year only had his wife’s name on it this time — not his.

Got the confirmation from my step uncle (whom I didn’t even know existed) this past weekend and sounds like my father is probably around stage 4/stage 5. I’m not sure what I’m supposed to do from here as someone who’s not exactly in his life but feels obligated since he is my father. On top of all this I live in TX so not exactly a cheap drive up for a visit that may not even be wanted. Do I just wait to hear from his new family about what is needed? To be completely honest… I don’t know if he will remember who I am. I haven’t seen him since my wedding in 2019 and at that point he didn’t recognize my little sister and I think he only recognized me since I was standing out in my white bridal dress.

For context - I am one of his two children. My little sister wants nothing to do with him and it’s been that way even back when my parents were together. He cheated on my mom with my (now) step mother so she wants nothing to do with him either. It’s just me really “directly” involved. I do have a therapist I talk to regularly and am getting my own coping relief from there. I’m jut feeling like I’m being pulled in a bunch of different directions and I don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing in this situation.",1
"I’m a caregiver at a memory care facility and it never fails that I have a resident try to refuse a shower. Most of the time I just let them refuse it and give them a sponge bath when they are changing into pjs. But last night was tough. I had a resident with severe depression and acute dementia that was NOT getting into the shower. She had just gotten out of behavioral health and her hair was a rats nest along with a greasy mess. I sat in her room for a good hour after she refused everyone else. I walked her into the bathroom and sat her on the toilet. She took all of her bottom half of her clothes off and then froze up into the “no no no, leave me alone” phrase. I reminded her that “your family loves you and would enjoy seeing you clean” “your grandson would like to see you tomorrow” but she also said “I’m going to have a shower at home” we white lied and said “for now we are staying here because the roads are closed, but they can pick you up in the morning” we eventually got her into the shower after a long battle of convincing. But I don’t want this to be an everytime occournce. What has worked for you? Can we make this process go any smoother?",1
"My mom has always been difficult to be close to and it's getting worse. Moderate stage mixed type vascular and alz (diagnosed 2 years ago). She has always been a ""they're out to get my money"" scarcity mindset type person, and this has been magnifying lately. ""They don't know what they're doing around here"" (believing her meds were wrong but med records show she had forgotten they gave her pills).  Refusing to spend much time at my home at Christmas because she insisted I never invited her over, so she had lunch in the dining room instead of christmas lunch at my house. ""Nobody ever tells me anything"" 

Feels downright spiteful even tho i know thats not the entire truth. No use trying to reason with her anymore when she's stuck in her own world.

Now I feel stuck in the middle because my mom has been a real pill to my mother-in-law. They live in the same facility, used to be friendly, but my mom now basically ignores mom in law, turns the other way if she sees her coming, and grunts and walks away if MIL even says hi. MIL's feelings are very hurt by all this.

In the past month, I've taken my mom to 8 medical appointments, had her over to my house twice, and gone out to lunch once that wasn't related to a medical appointment. She calls 2-3 times per day. I have seen MIL ONCE when we had her visit, talked to her on the phone twice. Meanwhile MIL is a sweet and kind person who has her own problems that I am ignoring because i dont have the bandwidth to help more.

Today I stopped by my mom's apartment before taking mom in law shopping and to lunch. When my mom found out I was spending time with MIL, she got really pissy and said ""well I never get to spend any time with you!"" ""She has two sons to help her! Why does she need your time too!?"" 

I realize all too well dementia is pernicious and aggressive and all this will only become more magnified. Somehow I hadn't anticipated how hard this social piece would be. Do I just imagine her as having the social emotional skill of a 4 year old? Lie and not tell her my other plans to preserve her dignity?

My mom basically imagines the world is out to slight her. Do I ask the doctor for meds for her paranoid anti-social jealous behavior? Is that a thing? She's not violent, just mean.",1
"Hi all. My dad is about a year and a half into pretty severe dementia. One of the most troubling symptoms is that he’ll obsessively scratch himself until he bleeds. It’s really hard to get him to stop once he starts, and he does it daily. 

He’s in a nursing home now, and they’ve prescribed a medication (I’ll find the name of it) to help, though I can’t see any progress so far with that. When he was at home, we tried covering his hands with mitts when possible, but he’d get them off and go back to scratching.

Has anyone else dealt with symptoms like this, and did you find anything that helped?

Thanks so much for any ideas. We’re at our wits’ end trying to figure this out.",1
"He’s 79 years old. He lives with my wife and I (mom lives with us too) My sister and I suspect dementia. I’ll get to that later but wanted to give you some background.

For the last 3 years he has given away every penny he owns to African “friends.” On 2 separate occasions he was told he would have to leave our house if he didn’t stop. We didn’t go so far as to take his phone away from him or get POA. He would fight us on it and then begrudgingly agree to stop. 

He’s always been financially irresponsible and kind of just a do whatever he wants kind of person even if it hurts others (little empathy).

Well, I’ve been getting some suspicious vibes the last 3 months  (getting off the phone quickly when someone walks in the room, guarding / shielding his phone). 

Also he has zero money in his bank account at all times (I hear his calls arguing with the bank - there should be at least 79 cents in the account still / I need you waive these overdraft fees etc), and I heard him making calls about consolidating all of his debt / loans. Mind you his income from SS and a small pension is about $2400 a month and his expenses are about $500. So he should never be in a deficit and certainly not borrowing.

Friday I heard him on the phone with one of them. I could hear the accent and him calling my dad “daddy” which I’ve heard before on previous phone calls I’ve heard, and talking about sending more money when he can.  He didn’t know I was around the corner. He finished the call. I asked him who it was and he came up with a quick story that it was my nephew and he was talking to him about sending him report card money. I had my brother in law check my nephews phone and the two of them had TEXTED on THURSDAY (not the phone call I heard on Friday).

I’m ready to kick him out, but my sister (who doesn’t live with us) and I think he may be in mental decline. Here are some symptoms: increased sleeping; increased poor judgement, loss of initiative, a sense of urgency about getting his affairs in order.

Sounds like some indicators of depression and / or dementia right? The thing is it’s hard to tell if this is those things or just an evolution of who he already was (terrible with money / lying to cover his tracks / no empathy / doing kind of whatever he wants to do / telling inappropriate jokes to get a rise out of people / etc)

Anyway, thanks for listening. If anybody has any recommended next steps or insight or additional subreddits you recommend for this situation please let me know.",1
"My closest friend for over forty years has suffered a series of strokes that has caused significant brain damage. She lives across the country from me and we speak on the phone about once a month. She was never good at managing her finances and now it's a complete shambles. I know she is jealous of my more stable situation and she also wants my help. However she isn't able to focus, to take any steps to change her situation or to understand that her young adult children aren't mature enough to help her. I wonder if there's any practical advice anyone can offer?",1
"My 71 year old father with dementia lives with me and has very unpredictable bowels. I’ve spoken with his doctor about this before and she said it’s part of the disease. His brain isn’t recognizing he needs to go to the bathroom until it’s basically too late. I will be bringing it up again at his next visit. 

I want to spare the details, but we had a situation today where he was unable to hold his bowels and had to relieve himself in a highly inappropriate place. Most of the time he’s able to make it to a bathroom, but the bathroom we found today just so happened to be out of order. Note: we live in the middle of nowhere, so running errands usually requires a 45 minute to one hour drive. I always make him use the bathroom before we leave the house, but today we just got unlucky I guess. 

I gently tried suggesting he wear adult diapers in the future when he has to go on long drives with me and he was highly offended and disgusted I would even suggest it. He kept saying it’s normal to have accidents like these and when ya gotta go ya gotta go but…you can’t just poop wherever you want. The world is not his toilet. 

Anyways, are there any alternatives to going straight to Depends? My aunt suggested taking Imodium before long trips? I told him he can’t come with me on trips anymore if we can’t find a solution for this problem which may be motivation because this man hates nothing more than sitting at home. Please help!",1
" I'm 23f and I'm secondary caregiver to my    grandmother with dementia(severe to moderate). I don't really know which type because she was never formally assessed for it. She had recently been complaining of shortness of breath which has now turned into a complete asthmatic attack lasting over a week. It worsens during evenings and nights. She can't do anything (visit the toilet, eat,drink Or stand/sit down) without starting to pant, or heave. Its so bad that we keep thinking she's taking her last breath. The doctor has prescribed her deryphilline. Its scary to watch her deteriorate like this. 

The hospital system here is a whole circus & she spent a week or two in there recently for a flu so we don't want her hooked to more machines & she gets violent when she's admitted throwing away the IV multiple times and losing a lot of blood and getting scolded by the attenders for not paying attention to her. The insurance system is pretty shitty too. We're in an Asian country facing recession btw so rehoming is not an option either(illegal unless the patient is in a coma or something+super expensive). She has also become severely Underweight (72 lb) 


She has a slightly defective heart, and has had a couple of strokes in the past which obviously aggravated her dementia(all hospitalized and treated and is on medication for the same) . 
Severe incontinence, choking when left to eat without supervision, frequent UTIs due to not cleaning, sundowning, forgetting people and incidents within a minute or two etc are her dementia related symptoms. We can't leave the home even to run errands for more than half an hour so we've all made adjustments and we do love her. 


But this is so hurtful to see someone you love wasting away and so weak. So I keep wondering how long she will live but it also makes me feel guilty. This is hard.

Edit : what makes this even worse is that she seems to go back and forth. SEEMINGLY on the verge of death and then back to ok. This is emotionally draining and confusing hence this post.",1
"My Babcia died today. She had been struggling with vascular dementia for the past year and deteriorated rapidly in the last few months. 

She's not suffering anymore. Not having to deal with being bedridden and hospitalized anymore. She's not confused anymore. And she doesn't have to choke on her own secretions anymore due to her dysphagia.

Last night I told her ""Goodnight Grandma"" together with my brother and this morning she was gone. 

It doesn't feel real. She looked like she was still sleeping when I saw her. 

I wish that I could have even 10 more minutes of listening to just her breathing. But I'm comforted that she's now at peace.

She will be part of me forever. I will never forget her. She raised me and I love her. 

Goodnight Babcia, I'll see you in heaven.",1
"Exactly 4 years ago, I flew to get my Aunt who appeared to be suffering from severe confusion. I drove her to my home and moved her into our guest bedroom. I took her to get diagnosed when she arrived and she has vascular dementia. She's on meds and my partner and I have upgraded her diet (we discovered she was eating expired canned food) to whole, unprocessed foods and very little sugar.

I'm 51 and my daughter is about to graduate college and go live her life. I'm now stuck wondering what is in store for me. I've been a full-time, stay-at-home caregiver for 4 years and, with my Aunt doing relatively well (except her memory), this could be my life for the next 5, 10 years or more.

My Grandma, my Aunt's Mom, had dementia and my Mom/Aunt put her into nursing care immediately - back in the 80's when it was relatively affordable and my Grandma had investments that paid for her care until she passed. (The nursing home was about 30 minutes from where my Mom and I lived - so we'd visit her once a week. My Aunt lived in another state and not sure she visited her once after she was put into nursing care.)

Locally, memory care is incredibly expensive - about $10K to $15K a month in my area - and while my Aunt put some money away, it would be gone very shortly. My Grandma lived over a decade with dementia so I don't know what the future holds for my Aunt.

Right now, I'm very fortunate. My Aunt can still walk, feed herself at the table, use the bathroom, and take a shower with a lot of step-by-step instructions from me. And she has a pleasant demeanor. My Grandma was the opposite - so I am grateful about that.

But what now? I was hoping to move to a new city, travel more, and finally do a lot of the activities and things I had put aside while raising my daughter and helping her get through college. I work from home so I can be very mobile. But I feel like I'm now anchored to my house full-time while I take care of my Aunt. 

I do go out every so often - but feel guilty because if she has any issues, she can't use a phone or help herself. So I don't go out often. 

I don't travel. I tried to travel and have a caregiver come in for about 4 hours a day, but after that trip (and seeing on the home alarm app that my Aunt was locking/unlocking our back door about 120 times at 3am) I now realize that she now needs a full-time person in-house if I leave - and, as you can imagine, those costs add up for any length of travel. 

I dunno. I just feel I'm in a weird spot. I love my Aunt. I have a very tiny extended family. It's just my Mom and my Aunt. My Mom, who is 81 and 100% with-it, lives with my brother in another state. And I have my Aunt. 

I just don't want to look back on my 50's as the decade I gave up. I know this might sound selfish. But life is short and there's only so long I can put my life on hold.

I dunno. I'm just frustrated. I'm tired. And I feel like I'm caught in a daily loop that never changes. And I'm not sure I see hope in the future for it changing either.

Anyone have any advice or ideas or feedback? I've held this in for 4 years but after bouts of depression about this, I feel like I finally have to at least say what I'm feeling out loud. Somewhere.",1
"I would like to share with you my tragic story:

My father (53 at that time) was diagnosed in 2016, it all started when he went to a 500km away town, my 2 sisters were also there by luck. he told them he was going to the coffee shop he goes to in our city, forgetting the trip he just did.

My mother took him to get diagnosed, and the first doctor told us he was just depressed and these were normal symptoms and that there is nothing to worry about, months later, we did another check, and, he was positive for Lewy Body Dementia or LBD.

I was 13 at the time.

It started with simple things, like him forgetting details or forgetting the groceries he was supposed to get, and his driving worsened.

Later my mum lied to him and told him that the doctors asked him to not drive the car anymore, and I believe she did right.

Then he started to forget how to use his phone. He no longer knows what button to press or what to click.

He also started talking to the mirror. He couldn't recognize his reflection, thinking it was someone else.

A few months later, I woke up to a loud sound. I ran to his bedroom, where I found my two sisters also rushed to the room; my dad fell down his bed, for the first time.

No longer able to find his way, we were cautious about him leaving the house; It happened a few times, but hopefully, we always found him.

By the 4th year, he was unable to do anything on his own, and there was ALWAYS someone at the house

He started to lose control of his bladder, so it was time for incontinence pants.

Feeding him was getting harder as he no longer bites or swallows, and he no longer knows any of us.

More falls later, he lost his ability to speak, and now he can't communicate with us.

A year ago (the 6th year), he started coughing uncontrollably. We took him to the clinic where his lungs were vaccumed. Turns out; he chocked on some food a week ago, and it caused him an infection, so he stayed in the clinic for two weeks. We also got him a gastrostomy (a tube set into the stomach from the abdominal wall, made surgically for the introduction of food.)

When he left the clinic he was never the same. He was never able to walk anymore, and now he is always either on his bed or his rolling chair.

his constant laying on the bed got him bedsores in a few spots in his body, and he now gets skinnier day by day.

he is still alive, always coughing or screaming in pain. and I believe that his end is not too far away.

Thank you for listening.  


Edit:   
My dad passed away on the 21st. May he rests in peace.",1
"Every few days my grandmother experiences episodes that seem to come out of nowhere during which she begins to panic because she is not in her house. She says she was at her house yesterday (she’s been here since July) and she doesn’t know how she got here. With a lot of her hallucinations and confusion we can just go with it and she is okay, but these are different. Logic obviously doesn’t work. Reminding her of where she is doesn’t work. And lying feels cruel in this instance because she does sometimes remember what we say. So telling her she can go home tomorrow for instance, could backfire big time.  It’s very upsetting for her and us and I really haven’t found a helpful way to respond other than riding it out. Any tips?",1
"Hi all, my 70yo mother has been acting differently the last year or so. Very forgetful, forgets what she’s saying or doing suddenly, has very erratic reactions to things changing when she didn’t before - the list goes on. She is still “mostly there”, she still works, she has way more good, Lucid days than bad, but it’s obvious it’s in a slow decline still, and my brother wants to get her to the doctor which I agree with. We are both concerned it’s the beginning stages of dementia, but obviously can’t be sure unless we have some sort of diagnosis. 

However, his plan is to “trick” her into going by saying it’s an appointment for him, and then when we’re all in the room to bring it up with the doctor and totally spring it on her. 

Is this a bad idea? I’m really not comfortable with it AT ALL but he is adamant that she won’t see a doctor otherwise. Is the right move for a parent who refuses to go, to “trick” them? If not - how do we go about trying to get her a diagnosis?

I worry this will make her insistence on not going to doctors worse, and I worry she will be even less trusting of us.",1

Anyways..the whole situation got me thinking-WHEN did this actually start?I can go back to at least five years-constantly repeating the same stories,sleeping more,losing interest in life and neglecting her home and appearance.Instead of putting this down to age the signs were there all along.
So,I wondered if any of you have looked back and realised that this awful disease crept in and took hold long before anyone realised?And if so,how far back do you think it started?

"My 82-year-old grandma might have dementia, she has been showing many classic symptoms and my uncle has taken her to a neurologist for tests and we're waiting on results, but we're all pretty confident it's dementia because issues like this run in the family + the memory loss that has been getting worse as of recently.

Anyway, the funny-but-concerning bit as of lately: my mom, during the calls that her and my grandma do every week, had to explain what the ""green vegetables that look like trees"" are. Mom had to explain it was broccoli, ***twice in one month.*** 

I was flabbergasted hearing this.  She's a native English speaker, she has known what broccoli is pretty much her whole life. Dementia is one helluva disease.",1

In order for the benefits of the insurance to kick in he needs to have a doctor approve that 2 or more of the following Activities of Daily Living (ADL) are affected:

* Bathing
* Continence (controlling bowels)
* Dressing
* Eating
* Toileting
* Transferring (in/out bed, chair, wheel chair)

Is it safe to assume that if his conditions worsens that he won't be able to do 2 or more of the activities above? Or will he most likely be able to do all activities, he just won't have full memory capacities?",1

Edit to update: He passed this morning just before noon. He was surrounded by family and as sad as it was, we are all at peace.
Thanks again everyone for your support. I can’t believe I will be living the rest of my life without him. 



Hello everyone. This week has been difficult. My father (70) was diagnosed in 2015. It’s been a long journey. He has been on hospice since October.

During the weekend he got an infection (a common occurrence of course, with catheters). We decided not to take him to the hospital. He has gone 9 times for the same reason in the last year.

My 4 siblings and I, all adults, made this decision with our mother. He is due to pass any day at this point. 

As heartbroken as we are, there is a weight that has been lifted with this acceptance.

It absolutely warms my heart that one of their cats has been at his side for the last few days. He always said he wanted a “big fat cat”  on his lap when he got older. 

The priest is seeing him this afternoon. 
 
I am so grateful for this sub. I don’t think I ever actually posted here but reading those of others really helped me through this.  

Thanks.",1
"Hi all,

My grandma has mixed dementia and has increasingly become aggressive so the older people’s mental health team have suggested trying her on 0.5mg of risperidone. 

They’ve explained there’s risks and I’ve had a search online about it which has made me sway more towards not putting her on it. Apparently the first few weeks are very risky for strokes and her mother had one. 

Has anyone got experience with this? What did you decide and how did you get to that decision 

This is time sensitive and it’s a last resort before the care home kick her out to a nursing home which I cannot stand the thought of 

Many thanks",1
"I admitted my father in a memory care faculty today. He’s such a sweet man and I hate this is happening to him. He was diagnosed in May and it’s been a whirlwind ever since. On pins and needles every other day, worried about what he’s getting into and what urgent situation was about to occur (that most of the time turned out to be nothing). 

My mom passed away in 2016 and I’m an only child. The weight of his care, finances, everything, fell into my lap overnight. I didn’t notice the warning signs. And I’m having extreme guilt. There’s no other solution that would’ve worked besides having him in a facility. Aside from him not eating and loosing touch with reality, he was calling spam mailers all the time thinking they were real and he needed to act on it. He went missing for a few hours last week and we had to get the cops involved. But even when I think about all the things that were happening and his progression, I feel so sad and guilty. Today when I picked him up, he forget we were going and I had to re-tell him again and watch his face go completely sad. I don’t think I’ll ever forget the look he gave me. 

Anyways… I needed somewhere to vent. I don’t have anyone in my life that has gone or is going through something like this. He asked me today if I was his daughter. It made me sad but it makes me even sadder to wonder if he’s struggling in there. I just want him to be ok.",1
"My 74 year old mom has “advanced Alzheimer’s”. What this means for her is this:  
- believes she is college aged and works at the memory care facility (she was in healthcare before she got AD)
- does not know year, age, or where she is 
- cannot bathe properly or cook or dress herself  (executive function gone)
- wanders/gets lost & unable to drive
- delusions, paranoia and occasional hallucinations 
- 100% incontinent 
- unaware of her disease
- does not recognize family or that my dad died (still recognizes me most of the time though)
- not able to have meaningful conversation 
- obsessively walks (has lost 40 lbs this past year). 
-cannot read (she was an avid reader) or watch full movie or play piano (all her prior hobbies) 

She is like a young child in many ways and generally “ignorantly” happy (edit: they say she’s “pleasantly confused” at her memory care) and unaware of her circumstances.  Ten years ago she had a pacemaker placed. Her cardiologist says it’s time to replace the battery which is an outpatient procedure at the hospital. My brother and I agreed we wouldn’t replace it since we know mom would not want to live this way or ever get to the point of being bed bound or having to be fed. However…I do feel like I’m giving her a death sentence somehow. After being in this sub for over a year… and seeing the other folks at her memory care facility…I also feel like it’s a mercy to let “nature take its natural course” before she lives into that truly miserable state. Selfishly though I enjoy having her around as a friend - at this stage she’s not a terrible burden since she’s in memory care and able to walk, talk, and at least seem happy. I’m torn on what is the “right” thing to do.  I would love this communities’ opinion on this please!",1
"My parent has dementia and will not stop spitting out their meds. And they're irritatingly good at it. We make them drink something and eat food, but the meds still get spit out. 

Does anyone else have this problem? is there a fix? We can't crush it into food because surprise! Their eating also isn't consistent. The meds are meant to fix the eating and the anxiety but it can't fix anything when its not taken properly. And only makes things worse. Their anxiety is through the ROOF. 

My parent wants to die and thinks not taking their meds will kill them faster, and there's no reasoning with them because of the dementia. Anything we say gets forgotten immediately. We've threatened the ""take these meds or you have to be hospitalized."" and sometimes they will swallow the pills *i think*

"I need advice and maybe to just vent. my mom has dementia and is only 58 years old. her decline was slow enough for us to not notice what was happening until it was too late, but the decline over these past 2 years has been very obvious and intense. in november 2022 she suffered a fall down the stairs, and that completely sped up her dementia progress. before the fall I used to be able to have sort of normal conversations with her, she’d still have yelling fits and occasional delusions but i would be able to show her a photo of herself and she’d know it was her and where she was in that photo. the fall caused an immediate switch almost over night. i believe it could have been hospital-induced delirium? but either way she seems completely gone at this point. coherent conversations are impossible, she won’t recognize my dad and now talks about this other husband and other children she doesn’t have, she has stopped walking, it’s really bad. my mom and I haven’t had the best relationship, but we were apparently really close when I was a child. once I got into middle school I started to rebel against my mom and we’d fight all the time. it only got worse between us, i’ll admit she can definitely be diagnosed with narcissism and she wasn’t the kindest but damn I could have been so much nicer to her. i could have involved her more, complimented her more, paid attention to her more. now i’m like mourning this person who is still alive, my mom’s body is there but the mom who raised me is gone. are you guys able to view your loved ones as the same person they were before dementia? i’m having a lot of trouble being able to do that. the worse part is like, i feel like she’s gone and i didn't even say goodbye. the last thing she probably saw from me during the last moments of her being coherent is probably me fighting with her. she used to always ask to spend a day with me, to bond more, to help out more. she would say she felt so unappreciated, would even claim i didn’t love her or that I loved my dad more. and i always gave half-assed reassurance, or take it as an opportunity to criticize her more. i used to think i was completely in the right, that i was defending myself and that she was horrible. but i could have done so much better. i don’t want her last memories of us to be her feeling unloved and thinking i hated her, but i feel like that’s the reality of this situation. i wish i could go back in time and treat her netter, i wish i could talk to her pre-dementia and reassure her that i do love and appreciate her. the mom that i knew seems to be gone, and i don’t know if i’ll ever get to see her true self again. idk if i’ll be able to tell her I love her and have her fully understand the meaning of it or even fully understand who is talking to her. i just want her to know i love her and i appreciate all of the work she put into raising me, i want to apologize for not showing her my appreciation and for taking her for granted. i’m so sorry to her. fuck.",1
"My dad has been living with dementia for six years. Recently he was hospitalised for a few months after he had a bunch of seizures. When he went in to hospital he was relatively independent but had been living in an assisted living facility because he couldn’t cook or clean and often got confused and lost. But he was walking and dancing and quite socially active. 

Since his hospitalisation he’s declined physically and has a pronounced tremor. He’s a fall risk and needs a wheelchair. He’s had to move to long term care. He’s tired and sleeps a lot and is frustrated and confused because he doesn’t know where he is or why he’s in a wheelchair. 

I try to go see him a few times a week, and we always have nice visits. I’m impressed with the progress he’s made (when he first moved to the new facility, he couldn’t feed himself or use his hands; now he’s doing both just fine), but all he sees is that he’s in a diaper in a wheelchair. He doesn’t remember the last months in hospital (which is a blessing) and only sort of believes he was in a coma for three weeks. 

To us, he was palliative but we got him back! To him, he was healthy and now he is disabled. In the ensuing time, we’ve learned he was becoming incontinent, was hiding his dirty clothes and blaming the care staff for stealing, and had become unable to use his telephone. 

I guess where I’m going is that sometimes, I feel so bad for him I don’t even want to visit. I DO visit, because he’s still here and I love him. It just hurts so much seeing him so sad. There are times I wonder if maybe it wouldn’t have been easier for him not to have woken up at all.",1

It was very interesting but now I have the constant fear and paranoia of the fact I might one day suffer from this or my parents, same with just my overall fear of death.

Unfortunately, my mother was a textbook narcissist before being diagnosed with Alzheimer's and was not capable of empathy.  I never knew when I was being gaslighted or what was the truth.  She is in early (according to 1 neurologist) or moderate dementia (according to another) so I am giving her the benefit of the doubt that when she lies/mispresents - it is the dementia.  My sibling and 4 of her 5 siblings are unwilling to deal with her. Myself and one of her siblings, who lives in another state, are the only ones caring for her - they come every couple of months.  We are now on our 14th caregiver in 6 months because no one wants to work with her (using an agency).   She has 1 friend who can deal with her only for limited time,   In our state, you have to be severe to be declared incompetent to be put in a facility.

It is not unusual for her to call me 10+ times per day or to have panic attacks in the middle of the night because she refuses any anti-anxiety meds- I have kids and work full time.  It has reached the point that I say if she feels she is having a heart attack (she has had every test under the sun and is totally healthy)- call for an ambulance.   She then goes on about how no one cares for her, everyone is so mean with her, and all she wants to to be part of a family, etc.

"My family member with dementia cares a lot about appearances.  She is not always symptomatic, and when she is lucid she keeps trying to push to stay in control of everything (including finances, family decisions, house maintenance and repair, business, everything).  She gets quite mad when this is challenged in any way, and doesn't ever let anyone think she has anything wrong with her.

Recently we have started renting her a wheel chair when we go places, but she has started pushing back as she doesn't want anyone to think of her as someone who needs a wheelchair.  She will buy one for herself once she becomes old and realizes that she does actually need one (80s and a mile a day is a lot).

"My 74 year old mom has advanced Alzheimer’s dementia. I would estimate her decline started around 10-ish years ago when she retired from working. Maybe even a bit earlier as I looked through her old purse calendars. My mom’s father died from Alzheimer’s in his 80s. 

I am 41 and have never really had a a great memory. It was always a joke with my best friend on how horrible my memory is and how without her I would remember nothing about college (we enjoyed the full party college experience- haha). I’m currently the primary caretaker for my mom- to clarify, she  is in a memory care facility about 3 miles from  my home- and I see her very often (usually 2x a week at least). Today I wanted to text a friend about meeting up at a popular place called Armature Works. For the life of me I couldn’t remember the name of it. I’ve been there many times. I’m not overly tired and can’t think of any excuses on why I can’t remember the name. I wracked my brain trying to remember and well… I guess I had a little meltdown. I’m so terrified that I will have this disease. I have a 3 year old and a 6 year old and a wonderful husband and life. I’ve recently quit my career to spend more time with family and focus on me as last year was so horrendous after my dad died and taking care of my parents estate. 

I’m devastated at the thought that I may have early onset Alzheimer’s (no actual proof of this)and heartbroken that I might not remember these wonderful people. I am a rational and logical person usually. I know that I can’t do much about if I really do have Alzheimer’s. And I know I should not dwell on this….but right now I’m just wrecked.  Every time I can’t remember something or a word- which is at least once a day - I feel so much dread and sorrow. I don’t know what I need other than to probably talk to a therapist and up my meds…. I just needed to share this with others that maybe understand.",1
"My sister took my mom to the endo yesterday, they ran her freestyle history and it showed she is only testing and correcting her blood sugar when she is with family on the weekends. 

My mom was diagnosed with vascular dementia in 2016 and has been living independently in a 55+ active apartments (I manage her finances). She was hospitalized with the flu, DKA  and heart attack in mid January and completed rehab after two stents.  It's now clear to me that she has stepped down in memory part of the disease. I am not sure what to do next. I just renewed her lease. She has a dog and friends where she has been living the past few years. We are in Texas. She has 150k in her IRA that I use some funds monthly to supplement her SS for all her living expenses. She is used to living off rich men (she also was rich once but blew it all on younger men) so she is not happy with this barebones lifestyle. I am a cancer survivor with chronic health issues resulting from treatment, a young daughter and a high pressure consulting job (with travel). I am feeling so numb angry and confused and sad that I can barely function on the weekends and when I sign off from work. I guess I am looking for advice and guidance for next steps.",1
"I am looking for some practical advice. My mom moved into assisted living a few months ago due to advancing dementia. Her facility does not allow coffee pots with heat elements, as they are a fire hazard, so we had to leave her beloved Bunn behind. I didn’t think my mom could master all the steps of a Keurig as she had never used one before and they can be a little tricky, so I got one with a thermal pot, which met all the requirements of the facility and has a more traditional set of steps that I thought she would be able to follow. However, she’s used her Bunn for so long, she can’t seem to grasp the new process with the thermal carafe. Her facility brings her meals to her room, but sometimes run later than she wants, so she likes to make coffee in her room a couple times a week. I would like to make this as easy as possible for her, but I don’t want to buy a keurig if she’s not able to use it.  She asks for her Bunn every few weeks, and I hate to keep telling her she can’t have it. Has anyone else been through this and have any advice?",1
"My mother (73) has mild to moderate dementia. She has for years (prior to dementia) dealt with anxiety that she never treated. MOST days she is good, but she is definitely dealing with depression, and occasionally (especially when we need to leave the house / run errands) she gets extremely anxious. This has gotten more frequent as she recently suffered a small stroke and her aphasia (speech) has taken another hit. Though she is making strides and getting better, she is frustrated and understandably feeling down.

The neurologist prescribed Zoloft and while at first, I was thrilled to potentially get her some help, I am now having concerns based on mixed reviews I am finding online.

I welcome any feedback + experiences (good or bad) you have seen. THANK YOU!",1
"   So my (f21) mother (f56) has been having cognitive issues for the past 2 years since having seizures which has since been classified as dementia.  I’m not 100% what type nor do I think the doctors know either (unsure though as I was in college for the majority of time tests were being done), I also don’t know how far along she is stage-wise. She is able to be alone for long periods of time, (hours until my dad gets home from work), feed herself, dress/shower/hygiene/etc., if that helps with any clarification. 

   The big thing is she’s definitely very emotional, and her memory- of course- isn’t what it is before. I just didn’t expect that at 21 my mom wouldn’t remember my birthday, let alone how old I am- along with a myriad of other things of course.  Like sometimes I feel silly and guilty for being upset over something as mundane as a birthday, but then I see my friends get calls from their moms and it just makes me want to go back to a time that was my mom if that makes sense? My brother and I also worry about future milestones that she might miss- weddings, grandchildren, etc. So I guess my question is, what are some good ways you were able to get through this?  Any advice on how to help emotionally while my world feels like it’s falling apart?  

   Thanks & apologies for any typos, I’m a little emotional right now.  I’m also new to all of this, so any general advice would be welcomed.",1
"My fiancé's mother suffered a traumatic brain injury 5 years ago that left her more susceptible to some form of dementia in the future. My fiance was on deployment for a year and return this past October. Since then, she has changed in how she handles situations/ things not going exactly as she wants/expects it to. 

&#x200B;

Since he has returned, she has changed her attitude towards us some and has gotten more easily pissed off at things she didn't normally get upset at before. It's at the point where I don't really feel like I am exactly welcome there, even though prior to my fiance's return, we've had a lovely relationship that was growing some. 

&#x200B;

Before deployment, he was living at home. Everything, for the most part, was fine between my future mother-in-law, my fiance, and I. He has been back for 5 months now, living with his parents.

&#x200B;

We have no official diagnosis of sorts, nor am I asking for one. Stories are welcome, as is advice if you choose to share. I am not seeking out affirmation or advice, however. I just simply want to know if it's possible for it to dramatically worsen from a situation like this where daily life changes.

TL:DR

Can a big shift in life/ change in daily life/routine trigger dementia to worsen dramatically?",1
"Hello everyone

My grandmother has had dementia for the last decade and she is in the final stages. She is as of recently sleeping a lot, not chewing/only eats liquids given to her with a syringe, she has stopped talking. My mother and I live abroad, right now im in a different continent even further away but my mother is closer and plans on traveling there asap, dropping everything at the moment. I know this is a difficult question to answer but is there a way to know or estimate how long it will take for my grandmother to pass? Based on your experiences how long did it take from these symptoms until passing? My mom is putting everything on hold for an undetermined period of time, and i would also like to try to make it to my country before my grandmas death.

Will it be weeks? Or closer to months?

Thank  you",1
"My 90 year old grandmother has dementia and has been living with my mom since the summer. She should’ve been moved for months before then, but she refused.  At the time, I was living a couple of hours away with a job I liked and some semblance of a life. My mom and I have a good relationship and spent a lot of time doing fun things together, shopping, binging tv shows in a weekend, etc. I moved back to my home town in October so I could help my mom because it was obvious she could not do this alone anymore. I was helping on weekends and driving back and forth and was getting exhausted. I have a job that is fine (I’m a therapist and I feel a lot more isolated in the practice I moved into) and a house that I’m never at. 

I’m feeling so burned out and angry. My grandmother is physically pretty healthy, but her dementia makes it totally unsafe for her to be alone… it’s gotten to the point that someone has to be awake with her 24/7 because she will try to slide out of recliner with the foot up or other things that set her up for a fall. We got her a hospital type bed, but she refuses to sleep anywhere other than her chair… so my mom and I have been taking shifts at night where she’ll sleep from 8:00 to 3:00 then I’ll go home and sleep. If I wasn’t working a full time job as well I think I’d be okay, but I am getting so tired and depressed. I’m also angry because we have lots of family who could be coming to give us breaks, but they don’t even offer. They’ll come for visits, but then my mom and I end up hosting guests rather than getting an actual break. My sister helps as much as she can, but she has young kids. 

I’ve talked to my mom about getting in home care, and she is open to it, but she doesn’t love the idea of having a stranger in the house while she sleeps. We don’t want to put her in a nursing home unless we have no other options because, frankly, the ones in our area are not good/trustworthy.

I’m 34 years old and I just feel its so unfair that my entire life is on hold and then I feel guilty for feeling that way. I love my grandmother so much and i truly do want to help make the last years of her life as happy as possible, but I’m so tired. I feel guilty when I go home for a break, I feel guilty when I go to sleep, and I feel guilty when I try to do something fun/distracting. I’ve tried to find a therapist and had an appointment last week, but I don’t know that I’ll go back to her… I think more than anything I need to go scream into the void. I don’t even know who I’m angry at. I’m just angry. And sad. 

Sorry for the long post and emotion dump… just needed to put this somewhere.",1
"Hi,
My Dad has the early signs of Dementia, he’s 74 and there is a history of it in the family. His mum, my parental grandmother had Dementia/Alzheimer’s.

We’re in the U.K. and the process to get him diagnosed through the NHS just seems impossible! 

He’s had two telephone assessments and a face-to-face all of which seem to have achieved nothing. 

It doesn’t help that Dad is in denial and locks himself away in a room when he has these appointments so the family has no clue what happened or what was said.

As a result my Mum’s mental health has suffered as she takes the brunt of all this and I’m worried something will happen to her long before we finally get this diagnosis.

Anyone been through this and know how I can help? Apparently I can’t talk to his G.P. as I don’t have consent.",1
I have heard of people becoming more lucid briefly before they pass. This seems different. Hospice removed her from imminent status(expected to pass at any time) because she went from making zero sense and looking almost catatonic (75ish lbs)to talking a lot and saying yes to food again. She has been improving for about 5-7 days. Has anyone else had this happen? Hospice seems surprised too.,1
"Hi everyone, I am new to this group. I have been dating my bf for 4 years, and now we are going to be fiancés soon. His grandfather, back in 2007, left the house and never came back. They searched for him for 7 years, but he wasn’t found. Grandfather’s brother had Alzheimer’s too. 
Now my bf’s dad might have alzheimer’s but nothing is confirmed yet. My bf feels that his dad has started showing symptoms and is worried that he will get Alzheimers too around his dad’s age. 

I have told this to my parents and they don’t support my decision to be with him. I am unsure what to do. All I know is that I am happy with my bf and we will deal with it when the time comes. Please help me process my thoughts if anyone was in a similar situation.",1
"So my great aunt has recently started throwing used toilet paper in the trash bin.. but now is flat out leaving it on the bathroom counter. She also no long washes her hands since I don't hear her use the sink.

"My mum which I care for, usually slouches and is slow when walking, but now she’s leaning to one side at a semi-extreme angle when walking and sitting. I can help her stand straight, but the second I stop helping she leans back over to one side.

"Since dementia sucks, this is one of the humorous things that happened this evening. My Grandma was drinking a small glass of juice and she's been working on her coloring book today. She decided to drop her crayon into her glass. Then looked at it. Moved it around in her glass. Eventually she pulled it out. But my Mom and I just exchanged glances and laughed. 

As we say ""Every day is an adventure in Dementia land.""",1
"I really don't know how I can explain all this but my life has fallen apart these last few years so I moved back with my parents right before the pandemic, its been really hard on my family and since May of last year or even longer my mom as been very delusional, as first, they were seeing people on the video camera feed, everywhere little blip was a person etc, she would constantly think she saw people sitting in our car, she started to think a movie by MGM was getting filmed across the street and that they had about 100 people in the tree filming scenes for the next avatar film, we did not see anything, then it got worse she was convinced naked homeless people were using our hose to bathe etc, then she started seeing them in the house even getting to the point the police were called.  She began to have talks with angels in the house and they were practicing going up to heaven or they were aliens we got her a dr who diagnosed her with lewy body dementia but they are not giving us much help at all I know she had a MRI or CT but I cant keep everything straight as I have a lot of medical issues myself during the day we can kinda manage and she stays pretty calm except when the cartoonists pant over her paintings but come night the house is a living hell she has also attacked my father when he was sleeping as the aliens were having an orgy on top of him and she had to save him.  My mom is convinced the hundreds of people she see are real and that I and my dad are just not able to see them.  I have tried a hundred times to use logic to explain any of this and she just thinks we are all idiots, she called the police and they explained she needs to trust us, we had the cities mental health team out here but being delusional is not a crime so they just asked she not keep calling them so now she just calls to the good aliens to take the bad ones away.  I just wish I could just deal with one problem at a time.  The doctor will give her one med and them wait months to try another its just so much stress, I also fear I will crack too as my sister has been delusional the past 3 years or so but we don't really know as she has been in another country where mental health is still like the 1950s. Sorry to vent as I know you have issues yourself, she thinks everyone is just an idiot and we will be sorry. I just need a rest.",1

But life is hell right now for her and for us, including the aid, even with around the clock help.",1
"I was in here years ago because my grandmother had Vascular dementia. She passed in 2019 and I miss her so much. I've only recently started accepting that I do have trauma from watching her decline. It still doesn't feel real that that was how she passed.

Anyway, Sept 2022 my mom had a sharp decrease in cognitive ability-hallucinations, making no sense, no sense of current reality time, place, etc. Convinced her to go to the ER and she was admitted for a variety of infections, malnutrition, etc. Her medical records say that she likely has Wernicke's disease. She had begun drinking a lot and went from functional to non-functional which we didn't know till we talked to her boss. If her symptoms began before the sharp decline, it was only about 3 months before she got help. She has made marked improvements but her short term memory is still poor, she doesn't have a full grasp on date and time to know that bills have to be paid, etc. I've accepted that she likely will not return to baseline and that depresses me a lot. I also am making peace with the likelihood that an actual dementia diagnosis will come in coming years even if she does return to baseline. 

I don't want to go through this again and I have so many mixed feelings because alcohol-induced dementia is not even on the same playing field as other versions. This didn't have to happen. I find myself wanting my old mom back. Wanting the mom who I know would go to work and talk about how she's so happy I'm in nursing school and my sister got her dream job. But at the moment, she doesn't remember that and I remind her often. She isn't cognitive of how long my grandma's been gone and before about 1.5 months post admission, she didn't remember she'd even passed. 

This disease is hell on earth. I dont' know how some of you all do it. I probably need a therapist but regardless, the reality of this and other brain diseases is something I wouldnt' wish on even my worst enemy.",1
"Hello. I care for an elderly woman who has dementia. We watch TV together most of the time but sometimes she doesn't like what is on TV. She said she likes movies but does not remember the names of any movies she's seen. She did say that she doesn't like movies with intimate scenes in them and I don't think she would like anything with violence in it. She does like pets, cooking, and home decorating. We usually watch Animal Planet, HGTV, and The Food Network Channel. Unfortunately, sometimes things that upset her are on like Pitbulls and Paroles, and Man vs. Food. The problem is I don't like movies so I don't watch many other than the occasional new release from Disney. So I can't think of any movies she might like. I'm hoping maybe some people here would have some recommendations.",1
"My mother has probably had dementia for at least 2-3 years. 18 months ago, there was a fire in her upstairs neighbour’s flat and she was placed in a temporary care home. Social care had been visiting her for a while as she has a number of health issues and has long struggled with alcoholism, so they were able to step in.

We have not had a good relationship for many years, she lives in Scotland, while I’m in the south of England. My parents divorced over 20 years ago, I have an older brother who has had no contact with our mother for over 30 years.  I’ve been in limited contact with her for a number of years and been more active with her since my cousin contacted me to say she was concerned with my Mum’s behaviour / memory / ability to care for herself.

After 6 months in the care home, we managed to get her flat to a condition where she could move back in. Unfortunately there were problems with the flat plus she dived into the wine in a big way and social care took her back to the same care home.

The home organised a hospital appointment and a consultant psychologist (I think) diagnosed her with mixed dementia, three specifically.  He strongly recommended that she not live alone again.

We had arranged power of attorney shortly before so this was activated.  We discussed her not being able to move back home again, and she was accepting of this, so I put her property up for sale to fund her longer-term care.

I’ve tried to find her a care home closer to family, without success. She was eventually happy to stay in the care home she was in, but was in a short-term specialist unit and so was moved to a permanent unit once she agreed to stay.  That was 10 days ago and she has been angry and upset since moving. Others in the unit have more advanced dementia which she refuses to be around, so is in her room with frequent trips to the smoking room.  I’ve driven to Scotland this weekend with my partner to clear her flat and visit with her. She called this morning in tears to ask when I was coming to get her and I travelled to collect her. I took her for a drink a chat, during which there were tears, some anger and a lot of upset. She asked about her bank account and paying for the care she was in and I explained that she would be paying for her care until her bank account reached a certain level and then the local authority would meet the cost. She asked what money I meant and I told her from the sale of her property.

To say she exploded would be an understatement. She stormed out to the street and was sobbing and swearing at me. She said she thought I was on her side and can’t believe I’m doing this. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen her so angry. After a lot of sobbing and anger, she very stiffly asked to be taken back to the home. I tried to talk to her but she said she was so angry she didn’t want to speak. We drove to the care home where she said thank you and slammed the car door and entered the care home.

We met with the care home manager who tried to reassure us but we are now wracked with guilt and doubt. We’ve been clearing her property as the sale should complete next Friday (there have been a million issues with the sale, but not important).

I’m not an emotional person but my partner and I are completely shell-shocked by today and are questioning everything we do. Unfortunately I don’t have anyone to talk to about this and have no source of informed advice so I wondered if Reddit might and sure enough, I found this sub.",1
"My 86-year-old father was diagnosed with dementia last fall after a few episodes of delirium and is now in a nursing home. One of the things that happened after he was placed involved exposing himself to a nurse and telling her how lonely he’d been since my mom died in 2017. Of course this was something that was completely went against his character and has stuck in my kind since learning of it… recently, I’ve seen this video making the rounds on Instagram of an elderly man, obviously in a nursing home situation and very likely in some state of dementia, asking a caregiver to “suck his dick.” She tells him that she’s there to care for him and he insists that if she did what he wanted, THAT would be “caring for him…”

The first time I saw it, it obviously ruffled my feathers after what had happened with my dad, but now it’s coming around as the subject of a “if you laugh you goin’ to hell” meme, with a split screen of some asshole displaying a shit eating grin as he watches the old gentleman proposition the nurse.

It’s pretty sickening, and I have to wonder who posted it originally… it’s shot from the caregiver’s point of view as if she’s holding the camera/phone, so I’m going to assume she posted it. I would hate to think that there’s actually a so called “professional” out there who would post something like that online for laughs… but I’d love to find where this person works so I could report her. Does someone like that even consider how seeing that video would make this guy’s family members feel if they just happened upon it?

I just felt the need to mention it here and get it off my chest. Maybe someone can find out where and when it was originally posted. Somebody deserves a heavy doxxing for that.",1
"Hello everyone, 

My Dad (61) was diagnosed with Frontal Temporal Dementia (FTD). Myself (27f) and my family (26f, 25m & 22m) currently care for him. We had no idea what was going on, as I thought for the last 13 months he was experiencing psychotic depression and complex grief disorder as we lost my mother (his wife of 40+ years) and 3 grandparents including his father over the space of 12 months.

As I know quite a lot about psychotic depression, I believed his symptoms were directly related to that. He had seen multiple psychiatrists who insisted he was fine and there was ""nothing wrong with him"" before we found one who saw through his act and he picked up on dementia last month after observing his behaviour during an inpatient program for depression and anxiety. It has been a long and stressful road to get to this point where we have some sort of answer regarding his diagnosis of FTD. I suspect the trauma of losing my mother to aggressive cancer has set this off rather quickly, although I believe looking back, he began to decline very slowly 3-6 months before her death. As soon as she passed in December 2021, his decline became very fast. I have been trying to understand/research a connection between rapid dementia coming off the back of grief, loss and trauma but I am not a doctor. 

He has lost the ability to write, he cannot dress himself properly e.g clothes on inside-out, shoes on the wrong foot etc. He sits and stares into space for hours unless we constantly prompt him to get up and move along. What concerns me is most days he'll just fall asleep watching the TV, as if he is in his mid 80's when in reality he is too young to be acting this way. Myself and my siblings want to keep his mind active during the day but I'm unsure where to start, is there some sort of class or therapist we could hire that would be able to re-teach basics like self-care, getting dressed and handwriting or is that too much to hope for given his condition? 

Another major concern for me is he almost choked to death and didn't even realise he was choking and tried to put more food in his mouth. He could not process how to open his mouth to get the food out. Most of his loss of function pertains to the mouth e.g speaking difficulty sometimes, being unable to swallow pills/feel them in his mouth, choking on food, unable to hold his mouth open at the dentist and the list goes on. This whole situation is devastating. Not only have we lost our mother at a young age, but I'm also starting to feel like we are losing him too. He was the most intelligent man, he holds multiple university degrees, was a talented full-time musician and even taught at one of the top Australian Universities back in the day. He is almost unrecognizable now. He realises what is going on but often forgets quickly and asks us about his condition. He repeats himself extremely often and usually just appears disconnected in conversation.

The rapid progression seems to have come to a standstill over the last two weeks and we just maintain his everyday life now which includes him being supervised 24/7. I fear this being a rare form of dementia and the fact we are in Australia, my resources will be limited and it will be hard to find the best medical help possible. I am willing to search for FTD specialists overseas and I do understand that would be a major cost but I have not ruled out going down that avenue if it comes down to saving him. 

What I'm asking for is some support. Is there anyone else in this position with a parent/relative/friend who has been diagnosed with FTD? Like I said earlier I suspect this quick onset was sparked by trauma, grief and major depression. He is being treated for depression right now and I do believe that has helped somewhat but what I really need is someone who has been down this path before to reach out. 

Thanks in advance everyone.",1
"Hello. Today my father was diagnosed with progressive dementia. He is currently in the early and mild stages. We are waiting for more information from tests, but the cause is either primary progressive aphasia or Alzheimers. He is only 64. 

This is all so fresh for me, but it seems like his disease might be moving fast. I am hoping anyone can provide advice on things I should do with him now, while I still can. I do not know how much longer I have while he is still “himself.” 

What would you do in my situation? I’m going to start taking more videos of him. Asking him questions and recording/writing down the answers. 

Thank you!

"My Grandma (84 vascular dementia probably stage 6) seems to be having issues understanding how to get up from chairs and picking her feet up to walk. It is like she tries to push up with her arms only and not really lift with her legs or hips when standing up. Or leaving her legs outstretched and not bending her knees.


Then with walking she just doesn't seem to pick her feet up very high. She is not a fragile old lady in the sense she weighs about 200 lbs. I'm sure her legs are heavy due to that weight. But we've not been too worried about that since she has always weighed about this and we know eventually she will lose weight as she progresses and has trouble eating. Part of the reason for the weight gain was forgetting she would eat breakfast or lunch and eat multiple times.


She did some PT 2 years ago to help with walking but even then it was difficult to get her to follow along. And now her ability to follow directions has really diminished. 


I guess I'm just looking for others experience. I know they can eventually become bed bound. But did your loved one just sort of forget how to walk?",1
"My neighbours are a senior Japanese couple and the husband has early dementia and has taken to wandering. He took a suitcase and got on a bus tonight. Who knows where he’d have ended up if someone hadn’t seen him get on the bus while out looking for him. I’ve been looking up resources and using gps trackers is a recommended option to consider from the Alzheimer’s society. 

 The wife has limited English which is more than my non-existent Japanese. She has a cell phone but is not very tech savvy. Their family are not close by.  I’d like to suggest a tile tracker for his wallet and house key but I don’t want to offend.  To be clear I’d expect his wife to have the account to track the items not me. 

I found a Japanese Alzheimer’s website talking about safety trackers and the tile tracker Japanese site and have printed them off but I’m hesitant about actually giving them to them.  When the husband is having a good day he’d understand the technology but I don’t know if he’d think it was an invasion of privacy or a way to help his wife keep him living at home longer. I don’t know how much he’s aware of his mental health.",1
"**Update:**  She refused to bathe after a dozen attempts (I tried turning on the water, setting the bathroom heater, music, fluffy towels, setting out her toiletries, giving her privacy, etc.) but it was too late to cancel the appointment so I took her anyway.  I offered baby wipes (all I had on hand) to do a quick clean but she told me to buzz off.  I was able to get her into clean clothes, but no other hygiene.  The doctor was shocked by her appearance; she's always been immaculately well-dressed.  She has lost a significant amount of weight in two months and was down to 84 pounds today (she has been refusing to eat lately).  He sent a message to her primary care doctor (same practice, she saw the pulmonologist today for a follow-up) and said if I don't hear back today, bring her to the ER tonight/tomorrow.  He said she looks dehydrated and at a minimum needs IV fluids; he diagnosed her with ""failure to thrive.""  He said the ER might also do some blood work and get the ball rolling on home care (we have been waiting several weeks for a referral after a December assessment by the palliative care team).  He warned that the ER visit could also spark delirium, but thought the dehydration (and refusal to eat) is a bigger issue.  Thanks to everyone here for your suggestions.  This disease is awful.

\--

My mom has Alzheimer's and refuses to bathe regularly, won't change her clothes unless pestered, etc.; if I can get her to shower every two weeks (!) that's a win.  I've used every trick to get her into the shower, and my old methods don't work anymore.  We're on a list for a home health care aide, but there is a severe shortage in our area.

She has a doctor's appointment tomorrow morning.  I always get her to shower the day before any appointments so the morning isn't as rough.  So far I haven't been able to get her out of bed today, much less into the shower and fresh clothes.  If she refuses to bathe before the appointment, should I bring her to the appointment unwashed?  What would you do?  She is filthy.",1
"Has anybody dealt with this? 

Last night one of the people who has been helping with my grandmother found her in bed. She had pooped and was pulling it out of her diaper and smearing it around. 

Up until this point most of her dementia has been limited to the realm of memory. This is a big jump into the realm of behavior

I guess she has also been getting up and wandering a bit. After a fall I began staying up to watch that she wouldn't do that. That's why we wound up hiring somebody to come sit, because I wasn't able to stay up and then also do so the things needed for both my grandparents and myself. 

Any insight is helpful. Thanks.

UPDATE: She does have a UTI! Thanks so much to everybody that suggested she might. I really appreciate it. I'll be headed to pharmacy shortly to go pick up some antibiotics.",1
"I'm the secondary caregiver for my dad with my mom being the primary and recently he came up to me very excited and said guess what and I asked him and he said ""I get to f**k you"" so I look at him and say dad I'm your daughter and he says I know so I told him that was not ok and I honestly don't know what to do because if I tell my mom then she'll want to place him and I'm 99% sure she can't afford that",1
"Hey there- 

Recently, my dad has gotten remarried and I have somehow found myself volun-told into keeping tabs on his new wife's mother, who has dementia. She actively ignores me alone and nobody else, however.

She has started wandering. At first, just circles around the small mobile home in which they live. Now, though, she actively keeps trying to go farther and farther. I have tried every sort of way I can think of to entice her to turn back, from offering ice cream, to tv shows, to phone calls with her daughter, to outright pleading or standing in the way. She ignores me and keeps going. 

I simply do not have the tools to deal with this behavior, especially given I've never been given an option to say no or that I am not comfortable with this. I have asked for advice from my new stepmother and her ""advice"" was to just accept it and let her mother deal with the consequences, but I know her and my father well enough to know I absolutely will take the fall of something does happen.

What do I do? Saying no isn't working as they will literally walk out the door and just leave me with her.

Additional clarification: She is not my biological grandmother, and I had quite literally never even *met* or *heard* of her before the first time I was surprise-volunteered for this.",1
"I've posted in this group a few times before, and I appreciate all the suggestions and feedback I've gotten here. 

I've been providing 24/7 care for my grandma with dementia and congestive heart failure for a month and a week. I work from home full-time while taking care of her. We don't have any care aids or assistance aside from a nurse who comes to collect vitals 1x a week. Our goal was to hire at least respite care once its financially feasible, but she continues to decline. My grandma is needing increasingly complicated care, and I'm struggling to think about her going to a facility. 

She needs a lot of help right now. Right now I prepare meals for her, administer medications, bathe her, assist with wiping when she defecates, help with diaper changes (frequent incontinence)and dressing. I also take her to all appointments, which has been a lot. I fill prescriptions as well as make sure she is getting nutritional supplements like boost, cranberry supplements to prevent UTIs and melatonin. I also do daily weight checks for her CHF, daily blood sugar checks for her diabetes, daily pulse and oxygen level checks. I also monitor all night through a motion alert camera to make sure she doesn't have any falls as she refuses to use her bedside commode in the night.   

She is mentally super confused with daily living, but tests extremely well in her cognitive exams. She doesn't remember very well, but is still highly vocal and conversational. She does repeat things over and over. She seems to truly enjoy herself being in my home for the most part. She in engaged in our daily lives and loves being able to spend time with us and her dog. And she is a thousand times better mentally here than she was in her rehabilitation center stay. But now she's having a lot more trouble with her mobility than she did at first. She's had one fall, and I have caught her and kept her from falling a few times.  We're supposed to do an xray tomorrow to make sure she didn't injure herself falling, and I'm not sure if her soreness is what's impacting her mobility. Sometimes she stands completely still in her legs, but let's her walker keep sliding forward. Or she runs into something and rather than adjusting she just keeps ramming it. She just had her blood work and urinalysis but everything looked great there and no UTI. She seems to also be a little dizzy, but cant/ communicate that with me. If she can't safely ambulate around my home, I don't know how much more I can do for her at home.. I don't know whether it's safe for her to be here. 

I am SO scared that as soon as she goes back to a facility she will decline. I love her so much. My parents both died of cancer before i turned 16, and she took me in without a hesitation. I can 100% say that i wouldnt be alive today if she wasnt there for me. It breaks my heart thinking that if i have to move her to a facility, i would feel responsible for her decline. She trusts me implicitly and we have a very strong connection as for the last 10 years I've visited her at least weekly while other family members werent interested. 

I have been solely responsible for her care, and my family doesn't help, but is not realistic or understanding her true situation. They just look for things to critique and act shocked when she has any little decline, and some seem to blame me. I'm truly doing the best I can, and I don't know how to go from here.",1
"Thank you to everyone here who has read my posts, kindly responded with help & tried to comfort me. Please know that you all helped me so much. I'm very heartbroken that my momma has passed. I also can't believe it is real. I'll still be here on this sub to hopefully help others on their journey. Rest peacefully my sweet, beautiful momma. ❤🌹",1
"My mom has dementia, and her short term memory is quite poor. I look after her a few days a week, and I'm looking for games that she'd be able to play that don't require her to remember previous rounds/moves/whatever. 

To give an example of the state of her memory, we tried to play ""go fish"" recently. Unfortunately, every time it was her turn, she would always ask for the same number, since she could not remember having asked for it on previous turns. She simply does not have the memory to maintain the thread of the game.

I'm thinking some kind of board game where each move is not dependant on the previous, but I'm grateful for any suggestions.",1
"Hi, 

I’m 24m from Canada. I was just told my grandpa was officially diagnosed with dementia. My mom is his main contact, but since she and my dad own a bakery, they work long hours, and I handle all of my grandparents’ appointments (financial, medical).

I should have seen this coming since all the signs were there, but I know this is one of his fears, and I didn’t want to believe it, so I had hoped it wasn’t. I could see it in his face when he doesn’t understand or can’t remember, and it hurts to see him confused (he was so on the ball when I was younger).

My family system is not the strongest (very dysfunctional), so I don’t know what to expect.

What can I expect? How should I act in the coming days? 

The media always portrays dementia as the end, but it sounds more like a journey. It definitely isn’t a journey I’m enjoying or would wish on others, and today just confirmed that for me. 

Please let me know if this post doesn’t belong and I’ll take it down. Thank you. I wish you all well, and I’m sorry for your pain.",1
"Dad (91) lives in a small care home.  With his dementia, he doesn't think anything is wrong with him.  He uses a walker but is always looking for times not to use it - like moving around his room - getting out of the car, etc.   But he's a major fall risk - he's wobbly and his feet are super bad with arthritis.  He refuses help in the bathroom - he locks the staff out.  (Why locks?  Dunno.  Although if there were no locks he would yell at them - he's mean.)  The owner is worried he's going to fall in the shower, and says after he poops he leaves a huge mess in the bathroom.  (Poop on the toilet, TP everywhere.)  

She has asked me to have a talk with him, but I can't imagine any way of getting through to him.  I once told him he had to stop calling a business he called daily.  I said ""Dad, you are bothering them.""  He said:  ""I don't care.""  My sister calls him ""Mr. Me Me Me"".

Any thoughts?",1
"Tomorrow I have to collect a urine sample from Mom. The doctor wants to see if her increasing confusion is from a UTI. I know it sounds silly, but I’m nervous. I’m a squeamish person to begin with. I don’t know how she is going to react to my request for her to pee in a cup/hat.

She wandered out of the house for the first time last week at 6am saying she needed to go pick her boyfriend up. She came back in when called and my husband and I have since installed alarms and a baby gate at the top of the front steps. 

She wakes up at 4am and goes right to the kitchen to eat. She thinks she is living in her parents’ home. She asks where her dad is. He died 20 years ago. She doesn’t talk as much but still recognizes me and my husband and kids. My dad is in the hospital currently and she doesn’t ask about him even though they normally live together. She doesn’t do anything all day but sit with her purse waiting to go somewhere. She naps a lot. 

One year ago my mom had not even been diagnosed with dementia yet. It seems to be progressing so fast.",1
"I feel rather ashamed of what I called the first post (screaming banshee) as it isn't very kind, but had really reached a point where I was at a loss and under a lot of stress and the screaming feels quite mad when she does it. 

We saw a neurologist today. This was after a morning where, certainly triggered due to nerves about going out, my mum shoved my daughter over by grabbing her over the face and pushing her backwards, and mum hit my partner (mums carer) with her stick because he didn't say excuse me as he walked past (we do know this is a trigger and we are good most of the time, he was just in a rush not that that helps). 

Mum has now been put on quetiapine which will gradually increase in dosage over the next week, and she has also been referred to the challenging behaviour team with social services

Scarily a safeguarding flag has also been raised with social services for our 1 year old daughter, or rather the consultant is writing to the GP to raise one.. Basically we are doing all the right things, and luckily my partner has safeguarding qualifications, but until mum is settled on her new meds and approved as safe by the challenging behaviour team, our daughter is a young child at risk in the eyes of the law... Was told if it gets to a point at school age where she is behaving in any of the ways she is being taught by her grandmother (with dementia) then we could be at risk of our daughter being taken in to care. Basically if mum does not respond well to new medication I will have to make a decision between my mother and daughter and of course the safest path is for mum to go into care.

We are trying so hard to give everyone a good family life while we can and help mum's savings last as long as possible, I really hope it's not too late and the meds work. If it's a choice between mum and my daughter there is no choice, mum will have to go into care and everything we've spent getting this family home together and getting it renovated to give mum the amenities she needs could have been better spent on care. Really was trying to do best by everyone. Terrified of speaking to social services, feel awful that it may be seen that I've put my own adorable daughter at risk. Never saw this behaviour from mum coming, it's been such a shock to us all.",1
"I (24) was visiting my dad (45) this past weekend. I've known something was wrong for the past year or so, but it didn't click until this weekend. 

As soon as I got to his house he started telling me about his new artwork on the wall and how excited he was about it. About 30 minutes later, he zoned out and it looked like his brain ""rebooted"" and he started in on the exact same conversation about the art on the wall like this was entirely new information. 

This happened three times in the span of maybe 3 hours. 

Not only did we have the exact same, word for word conversation about the artwork, but he also seemed to be losing motor function on and off. One minute he's stumbling excessively, then the next minute he's walking completely fine with no issues, back and forth back and forth. 

For the past year or so there have been increasing phone calls from him - started about once a week and has progressed to nearly every day now. At first I thought he was just lonely and wanted someone to talk to, but now we're having nearly the exact same conversation as the day before. 

We know nothing about his father's family history, but there are no records of dementia or memory loss on his mother's side (that I know of.) 

He is an alcoholic, so at first I thought this was all due to being inebriated, but he was completely sober during the weekend visit, which is what caused me to get this feeling that something is seriously wrong. 

How do I approach him about going to the doctor? 
He is stubborn, and is a "" I never get sick, orange juice will fix everything"" kind of guy. And - if this is an issue that will progress to the point of him needing daily care, what do I do? I don't have the funds to support him, I'm barely scraping by as it is myself.

Thank you all for reading, if you made it this far. I'm just lost.",1
"My 88 y/o dad has been losing his memory and mental function slowly for the past 5 years or so.  I  worked for him for 20 years before taking over the nearly bankrupt company during the summer of 2020.  He kept procession of the building that the company is in and has been collecting rent for the last two and a half years without issue.   Recently the global inflation has rocked the business and he has lost 30% of his stock portfolio.  Now he is demanding that I move out of the building so he can sell it and recoup his losses. So we had a long talk last Wednesday about it and he agreed to let me rent out the empty space in the back so he can earn more money, he was all smiles and happy when i saw him Thursday and friday.  Then he calls me Monday morning and tells me he has changed his mind and I am not going to tell him what to do.  In the last couple of years he has turned very suspicious of me, and now he is downright being mean.  I know this is the dementia causing this, but he looks at me as an enemy now and wont talk to me about it.  I told him we should keep the building in case he needs funding for elder care, and he yelled at me saying he plans to kill himself before having anyone assisting him in any way.  He is also going on and on about how much of a loser I am and how I should get a life.  My dad of 5 years ago would have never uttered these words.  What should I do?  I am the executor of the estate, I just want to make sure he has money left for elder care when the time comes.  He changed his will recently to leave my sister less because she refused to get vaccinated, and now he just changed his mind and told me she was right all along.",1
"I lost my father to dementia in 2018.  From 2013-2018, me and my wife were his primary caregivers.  It was an incredibly difficult path, as many people here know.  While I am sad he’s gone, it felt like a burden had been lifted after he passed.

So my family had a good year and a half of freedom, then Covid happened.  Gradually the world opened back up, and my family finally had the opportunity to enjoy some travel and freedom this summer.  Hooray, right?

Wrong.  Now my mother in law is experiencing an extremely rapid progression of dementia-like symptoms.  While I’m praying that it ends up being brain cancer or something else like that, I know that it is likely going to be another non-specific dementia diagnosis, and my family and I are going to be in it for the long haul as primary caregivers again.  Another half decade or more of the constant vigil, dreading every phone call and locking ourselves into a dismal routine, simply looking forward to the day she dies to regain the freedom most people take for granted.

It honestly feels like I’m being sent back to prison after being sprung for a brief moment.  I grieve for my mother in law, but mostly I grieve for my family’s loss of freedom and options.  The only travel my daughter will be able to experience are trips to the memory care facility.  Again.",1
"The good news is my grandma seems to really enjoy the latest in what has been a revolving door of caregivers. The bad news is I can't stand her. 

As soon as she walked in the door she asked where the bathroom was and I showed her to the bathroom my grandmother uses, which is also the bathroom that any guests use. She didn't want to use the same bathroom as the client so I reluctantly let her use mine, which requires her to walk through my bedroom whenever she needs to use the restroom.

She sits down and makes herself a cup of coffee before she does any work for the day. My grandma and I have breakfast before she gets there. She always asks permission before she uses the coffee pot, and a cup, but shouldn't she eat before she arrives? It's a full day shift so obviously she's entitled to a lunch break, but a lunch and breakfast break seems a bit much, especially when she's making it here. She washes her cup when she's done, but I can always tell which one she's used because there's still sugar at the bottom of it.

I generally prefer caregivers don't do much cleaning. If they want to vacuum my grandma's bedroom it's fine, the living room is fine, her bathroom is fine, but cleaning my kitchen is off limits. I told her politely she didn't need to worry about any of that, just sit with my grandma and keep her entertained. Then I come into the kitchen and she's wiping off the microwave with the sponge I use to detail the floors and she says ""I don't mean any harm, this is just what I do"" so she understood that isn't what I wanted her to do but chose to keep doing it. She'll wash dishes and put them away, most often in the wrong places, even though I've told her more than once I prefer to run them through the dishwasher. She put a load of laundry I'd left in the washer in the dryer and added fabric softener sheets to my workout clothes that should never have fabric softener. 

She doesn't like the recliner in the living room, so she moves furniture in from the kitchen and doesn't put it back at the end of her shift. She prefers to do her paperwork, whatever that means, from the kitchen table rather than in the living room with my grandma who is hard of hearing, so there are long stretches of the day where they are yelling back and forth at each other while I'm trying to work.

Something about her just makes me annoyed and uncomfortable. Part of me wants to spend my workday at Starbucks so I don't have to be around her at all. She's very sweet and well intentioned, but she has a lot of ""isms"". She keeps asking me if I think she's doing a good job and bringing out the best in my grandma and in my head I'm like lady, you've done 15 things I don't want you to do and have made 0 attempt to get my grandma in the bath, what do you want me to say? 

AITA? Overreacting? Should I say something to the company or just wait until my grandma runs her off like the rest?",1
"My dad is pretty far along and has lost most of his words. He hasn't had a sane moment in months,  but today he looked at me with clarity and said ""Remember the Beatles?""

This is such a weird disease.",1
"Hi all, throwaway account because my husband knows my Reddit. 

TLDR: husband is often forgetful or confused, can't understand instructions or stories of any complexity, ducks and dodges in conversation but appears fine (?) to outsiders - he thinks I'm gaslighting/manipulating him and got a doc to ""back him up"". I'm so drained I don't know what to think.

My husband is 55 years old and increasingly forgetful and confused over the past few years. Every day he forgets that we ever had a certain conversation, or that he had ever been to a certain place. For a while, I was questioning if he was just being very passive aggressive, having some private joke on me, or what. A couple years ago he actually truly couldn't find our own house on our street, which got very surreal and scary - but like everything, he has every excuse (""I was coming down the road one way, and thought I was on the other side of the road!"")

Like, I just had a colonoscopy, I've had a couple, and he always drives me, every couple years. On the way there I said, hey, do you remember how loopy I was last time from the anesthesia, ha ha? He said he did and that he had also had the same experience with his colonoscopy... and then two minutes later asked me if this was my first colonoscopy. 

but it's little things too. I don't really tell him a lot of stories anymore, because he just interrupts with a ton of questions or misses the joke or the point. He can't follow instructions with more than one, max two steps. He turns it on me that I am nagging or I ""live at level 11"" and he just can't keep up with my ""intensity"". 

I believe that he covers up a lot but can't prove it - his way of talking is just nod and agree, so I have found myself questioning him, ""do you remember? Like, do you really remember or no?"" (I realize that this is not helpful or recommended if he does have an issue.) If I press him for an answer or opinion besides ""I agree!"", he'll duck a few times with non sequitors and then turn it around on me and pick a fight.

anyway, he is super happy today because he asked his PCP about ""it"" at my urging. I'm sure he didn't tell him most of it, HE thinks he's fine except maybe forgetting some stuff - and according to him, doc agreed! He said the doc looked at an old MRI and didn't see any notes on the MRI so he's fine. No questions, no tests, nope, doc said he's fine. this has happened in the past with other providers, my husband has a great public persona, and I look like an idiot.

this can't be normal, I am so drained by having to pre-think through things, break things down for him without letting on, follow up on things, and also keep his feelings in mind, I don't know what's real anymore. 

I can no longer avoid comparing him to other adults or even kids around me, how I have to talk to him and do things for him that he can't do, the way he just agrees with everything or makes conversation by repeating what he's heard/read online and doesn't verbalize thoughts of his own.

I'm sitting here by myself right now because he just lit into me that I'm not always right and I THINK I'm always right but I'm NOT because the DOCTOR said he's fine. I had to just leave the room. 

I don't know what I'm looking for .",1

"I just joined because I know for a fact that I will need some help along the way and a place to vent/ask questions.

My father is 81 and we've gone from early on-set to fully into it within the last few weeks.  The moment I realized we were in huge trouble was when he couldn't relate or understand that the banks were closed on Sunday.   That was a huge ordeal and tough to manage.

We then got to a situation where he couldn't walk for some reason and we had to go to the hospital.  Thankfully my brother was and currently is in town to help out.   Everything from the hospital was normal that afternoon/night but they are headed back to the hospital this afternoon for a better MRI.

We are now at seeking home care everyday.   We met with a middle agency today and they will be able to lead us to the proper care.   My brother is based in Denver and is staying a few more days.  I work full-time and head back to work tomorrow.   There's a lot going on right now.

"I just posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/10v0paz/fil_with_terminal_cancer_and_possible_early) about the fight we're having with my FIL  over rehoming his out-of-control puppy. His childlike, poor decision-making is one of a few signs that seems more like dementia than depression, cancer or normal aging. 

He started treatment for depression after his wife died ~7 years ago and it helped a bunch. Things weren't perfect and he should've downsized, but he was living independently and it was mostly fine. Then he got COVID, and started declining fast. We thought this was mostly physical (he also has arthritis and kept putting off a shoulder replacement surgery) but in hindsight, there were also some signs of cognitive decline. Then he was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. We live 4 hours away and were only able to visit every few months, and he concealed how bad things had gotten and that his cancer was such a late stage. We figured that out on our own when we saw the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial he's enrolled in. 

 He stopped driving (he says due to leg weakness/pain,) became housebound and survived off microwave Rice-a-roni ordered from Amazon. He stopped brushing his teeth, and showering/changing clothes regularly. He was unable to properly take care of his two dogs, leading to the shit-show I described in the other post. He's always been a bit of a hoarder, but things got way worse. His house is a disaster. He has been losing things like keys and remotes, and tends to blame us for it. He is starting to forget recent events/discussions. He's developed a shuffling gait and can only walk short distances with the assistance of a cane/walker. He has had multiple serious falls, and exhibited very poor judgment in handling them (just lying around in the snow before finally calling elderly neighbors for help even though they physically couldn't, not telling us at all.) He's starting to have some problems with continence.

 This all started months, possibly even a year or more, before the cancer diagnosis. He's clearly been dishonest with all of his doctors about all of this. They were led to believe that he was functioning just fine independently and even still capable of doing work around the house. They had no clue that he was essentially bedridden, spending 24 hours a day in a recliner and getting up only to go to the bathroom and microwave meals. 

Once we realized how bad it had gotten,  we moved him into our home, about two weeks ago. He has VA benefits and Medicare through Kaiser, but we don't have Kaiser in our area so we've had his VA care transferred here, but we still need to drive him 4 hours back to the Kaiser clinic at least every 3 weeks for his cancer infusions. 

His first VA primary care appointment here is scheduled for Feb 13. We can't access other care services until then. 

I'm wondering if it's worth it for my husband to try to gently discuss our concerns beforehand, or if we should just try to email or discreetly discuss it with the new PCP before the appointment. Also, we don't have financial/legal POA set up yet. Is it true that it's better we try to get that done before a dementia diagnosis? Hopefully this is something resolveable, but he's had brain scans to check for metastases and I assume they'd have seen something like normal pressure hydrocephalus. His lab work is also mostly normal. From everything I'm reading, this really seems like it could be vascular dementia precipitated by COVID, or maybe LBD. 

Thank you all for all of the support. This is such a helpful community.",1
"A year ago my grandfather died at the age of 89 and ever since then my grandmother (she turned 88 last week) has been forgetful. She often asks double questions, as in, she asks things that she asked like 10 minutes ago.

 Sometimes we tell her something and she remembers it differently. This happened two days ago for instance. My mom sometimes eats with her, because she lives near. I was visiting last weekend and just as my mum and I were about to start eating dinner my grandma called and mom told her 'I can't call now, we just got take-out and we are about to start eating.' Apparently, she remembered/interpreted (?) it as that we we're going to her and would also bring her take-out dinner, because about 40 minutes later she called, asking when we would be there with the food. Eventhough my mum had told her earlier that day that today we wouldn't eat with her.

&#x200B;

It's getting me kinda worried. I just don't know if this is grief or dementia. I mean, she lost her lifelong partner of 60 years, so life must be very different and difficult now. I just don't know what's normal. I did read that forgetfulness and dementia-like symptoms can appear in grieving elderly people. Is there a way to find out whether this is still the result of grief, or dementia starting? :( She really doesn't want to visit her GP, as she had a very bad experience with him around her husband's/my grandfather's passing...",1
"Update: the puppy should be with his SIL by now. She's a few hours away. I am already so relieved. My FIL made the trip with my husband. I'm appreciating the chance to breathe but  miss spending time with my husband and need to take this opportunity to clean FIL's dirty room. :(

My 75-year-old widower FIL has stage IV lung cancer. We also believe he may have dementia (losing things and blaming us for it, very poor decision-making, progressively worse balance problems, numerous falls, refusing to bathe/brush teeth/etc and very argumentative about it.) Much of this seemed to start after he had a moderate case of COVID. He's high-risk for vascular dementia and we're wondering if COVID might have triggered it.

He had been living 4 hours away from us (30s married no kids.) The house is large, rural, in the foothills, and on acreage. We had been encouraging him to move closer to us for years. Our area has a slightly milder climate and is very popular with retirees so there's tons of services and community here for seniors. He's always been too attached to the house to leave. 

He started declining rapidly about a year ago, but got an Italian greyhound puppy anyways, as a companion for his 12-year-old IG. The breed is incredibly high-maintenance, and ill-suited to his lifestyle and the colder climate there. He never trained her. She is not house-broken and needs to be supervised because she gets into/destroys everything. She is also underweight. My FIL could barely manage to take care of himself, nevermind a puppy. He ended up in a broken recliner 24/7, surviving on microwave Rice-a-roni, surrounded by dog shit and piss and hoards of junk. He stopped driving (he says for physical reasons) and only left the house when driven by neighbors to medical appointments.

It was easy for him to hide how bad things had gotten because we called regularly, but hadn't been able to actually visit in a while. 

We had a concerned neighbor reach out to us after he fell in the snow and nearly died of hypothermia. He never told us about this incident. After he fell, he just laid in the snow for a long time before trying to call his elderly neighbors. They were unable to help him up, called other neighbors, who also couldn't get him up and after 2+ hours they finally called the fire department. They helped him inside but he refused to go to the hospital. One of the neighbors reached out to us a few days after that. My husband drove over ASAP. It was immediately abundantly clear that he's no longer capable of living alone. He hadn't even changed his clothing after the fall, even though it had been soaking wet and he finally acknowledged to us that he had this close call. Who knows how long he was wearing those clothes before he fell. 

We stayed with him for about a week before moving him into our home. It's been about two weeks. He cannot do any meal prep and needs help changing etc. He is physically able to do stuff like go to the bathroom, shower, and brush his teeth on his own, but he needs to be pushed to do any hygiene stuff. He only gets out of the recliner to go to the bathroom. 

The big problem is the puppy. We have been desperately trying to potty-train her, and despite our hourly+ efforts, she is making very little progress. She whines incessantly when crated and will destroy anything in or around the crate. Left unsupervised, she will chew on wires and pills that my FIL seems to constantly lose. She harasses our dogs and I'm worried she'll get bit and seriously hurt because she's so fragile. Our pets are visibly very stressed. We're losing sleep and our relationship is rapidly becoming more strained. It's just impossible to take good care of my FIL, the puppy, his other dog, and our own pets. My husband works full-time and I'm trying to find a job but this whole situation is making that impossible. 

My SIL is a vet tech, lives a few hours away, and is 100% willing and able to take the puppy, both temporarily and after he passes. This is clearly the only solution here that's fair to all of the people and animals involved here.

My FIL is refusing. We all got into a big fight about it tonight, and he's saying he'll just go back home and hire a caregiver, which is totally infeasible. He's on Medicare and there's no way he could afford that level of in-home care on his own. Even if he could, there may not be anyone available in his rural area. He said that the dogs are like his kids. I lost it on him and told him that the puppy isn't his kid, my husband is, and he's destroying us by choosing the puppy over us and his own wellbeing. I also told him how unfair it is to the puppy to keep her here like this, when we're unable to give her the attention she needs and she could easily go to a better place with family. Doesn't seem to matter to him. 

I'm just at a loss. My husband is so burdened right now. I have well-managed bipolar and haven't had a significant episode in almost 7 years, and I'm worried this is going to break me. I can't keep spending most of my day trying to train the most difficult puppy in the world and cleaning up piss and shit. I'm losing so much sleep which is super-dangerous for my bipolar. What the fuck do we do?",1
"Saw my mom today and I’m kind of shocked. She has been complaining about dads favorite show for years always teases him and makes fun of it. When my dad mentioned it has been on for 10 years now mom didn’t believe it. She thought maybe one year. I said no you’ve been with dad watching it every Sunday night for a long time, you always make fun of the narrator. She just looked blank. Yet she remembers characters on the show. I’m confused. 
She regularly repeats stories each time we talk not remembering she told me but this was different.",1
Mom (74) has been in a nursing home since October.  Her mobility is horrible and her dementia seems to be getting worse.  She had a short hospital stay last week for an infection and upon returning she was more confused.  Took her out today for a doctors appt today and she again is agitated and confused. While at the dr appt mom got antsy since it was a long wait.  She wanted to get up from her wheel chair and walk around.  She doesn’t remember they she actually can’t walk. So she causes a scene and makes me look like a horrible daughter who won’t help.  She kept taking down her mask (masks are required in this dr office). I kept asking her to put her mask up and she would say some pretty choice words about it. How do you handle taking someone with dementia out?  Is it best to limit the outings?  I’m struggling and feel so helpless.,1
"My mom (58) was diagnosed with FTD PPA in 2020. For about 3 years before that, we noticed that she was having some speech issues. My family just kind of shrugged it off and thought her thyroid medication was off. Eventually, my aunt and my mom’s workplace told my dad that they should look deeper into the cause and see what’s going on. They did head scans and it came back normal and her bloodwork was good. They saw a neurologist or some kind of doctor that performed some tests and asked her questions that resulted in her dementia diagnosis. 

I was 23 and planning a wedding and got married that fall. Usually a mom is right by her daughter’s side and helping with all of those fun things, but mine wasn’t. 

She was progressing in her disease but not at a fast pace. Then from July 2022 until December 2022, she progressed rapidly. My dad was her primary caregiver and eventually he had to call the police because he couldn’t calm her down. She was self harming herself, by hitting her head and digging her nails into her skin. They were getting maybe 2-3 hours of sleep at night and she stopped taking naps mid morning. She was trying to leave the house at night. 

She was placed under temporary guardianship and stayed in the hospital for about a month until the state found a facility for her. She’s about 2 hours away. 

I miss her. I miss how she was. She was my best friend. She’s my mom but she’s not the same mom anymore… We use to go to garage sales all the time in the summer. We’d go to the beach and the thrift store. We use to do crafts together. But now, I don’t have any of that… I won’t be able to share my babies with her. I won’t be able to have her over for coffee and do her nails. I just miss her so much. 

Thank you for reading my story. I know everyone here understand this feeling… and I’m sorry you are going through it too. Just know you’re not alone.",1
"My father passed away from pneumonia last night after 15+ years with early onset dementia. 

I was a young teen when I left home to live abroad, away from him, and he started deteriorating rapidly when I finished high school. I am now 33 and frankly feel like I have not known him for most of my life. 

I did not like seeing him and actively avoided him when I did visit my family home, because his deterioration was all the more obvious to me as someone who saw him so sporadically. I feel guilty about this but also know it was a rational response. 

I feel conflicted about his death: on the one hand I don't feel the loss acutely, and I feel guilty about this, particularly when I know my older siblings are suffering. On the other hand I feel sad when I hear others recall his earlier years. 

I just wonder what it would have been like to have him around as I was growing up, and today, as I navigate (relatively) early adulthood. 

Thanks for listening, just wanted to share my feelings anonymously. This is my first time posting and I hope I did it alright.",1
"Is this likely to be dementia?

We’re starting to worry about my mother (74).

Things that are new/out of character:

She has a rigid daily routine which she never deviates from. It’s very specific and involves doing, eating and saying the exact same things every day in the same order. 

Apart from going to 2 exercise classes and the supermarket once a week, she rarely leaves the house to go further than the dog walk.

We will talk to her throughout the day but she doesn’t do much back and forth conversation, it’s mostly broadcasting information relating to her routine, the dog or the weather. She will tell the same anecdotes over and over. I will be the same reminiscence triggered by a whatever we’ve said e.g. if we mention the pub it will trigger ‘the pub anecdote’:

‘Oh yes, I love that pub, I remember we always used to go there and sit in the table by the window etc etc’ 

She forgets the words for things (she just now called dumbbells ‘lifting tools’). Yesterday my son had a friend over and she asked what the friend’s name was 3 times in 10 mins.

We have to talk in very short clear sentences otherwise she will interrupt and steer the conversation back to her favourite topics - the routine/dog/weather. 

She wears the same 2 outfits every day, she eats the same breakfast, same rotation of  3 lunches and 5 dinners every day. She watches the same 3 t.v. Programmes every day - only game shows or music, nothing with a story. 

Her broadcasting of information is very good, so she seems quite normal, but only when she’s dominating the conversation. I would say her processing of information from others seems very poor, although it may be that she’s just not interested and isn’t bothering to cover that up.  

Is this likely to be the start of dementia, just mild cognitive impairment or just how people get when they age?",1
"Our Mom has advanced dementia so we know the signs and symptoms and we’re almost certain it’s now happening with Dad. He has made some comments about memory problems, but we’re not sure he appreciates the situation and the implications.

How have people dealt with this? A family intervention of sorts?",1
"My grandmother has had dementia for a few years now, though it’s difficult to say how long exactly. She lives with my grandpa who takes care of her (bless his heart). Her and my grandpa have always been fairly progressive people given they come from a rural small town. Since she’s started losing her mind, she’s become extremely bigoted and almost hateful and judgmental. One of my cousins is gay, and my grandma wouldn’t have cared five years ago but now she talks all the time about how sad she is that my cousin will never have a heterosexual relationship and “real” family. Yesterday my grandma referred to a mixed-race couple as “weird,” yelled at a man for wearing a hat in a restaurant, and commented that a girl we walked past looked like a clown for having blue hair. She was never very religious but also randomly decided she believes in god. She used to be so kind and sweet, but now she just seems kind of rude. I’m not sure exactly what’s going on with her, but is this normal? Do dementia patients actually become more hateful, or is she just reverting back to her old beliefs? It’s difficult taking her places now because we always know she’s going to say something rude. Sorry if this post is overly judgmental of me or negative or anything, I know she isn’t herself.",1
"Because of circumstances, it was not nearly as hard to stop my dad's driving as expected.  He'll occasionally ask to drive, but doesn't fight it much.  He's 78 and in moderate to early severe stages.  He stopped driving 2 or 3 years years ago.

He has been struggling with using things like a cell phone or remote control for a while now.  Probably a year ago it got where he got very frustrated when he tried to use it.  He couldn't make calls, use the Internet, or understand the apps.  So we generally phased him out of using it. 

Now, he asks frequently for a phone.  He uses ours if he wants to make a call and we help him with apps or Internet is there a need.  But he still gets frustrated.  

I am looking for ways to deflect when he asks for a phone.  I can usually come up with a distraction or fiblet, but for some reason this one stumps me.  

Ideas?",1
"I am 15m and during covid my grandpa was diagnosed with early on-set Alzheimer's.  Next year I am going into high school. My parents have decided that we should move back to the US so we are closer to him. I go to a international school outside the US only because my dad works there and I have never lived in the US. My entire life is here and I don't want to move. My grandfather when he was working was very career oriented and barely spent time with family. I have some good memories of him but I dont really connect with him that well. My entire life is here, all my friends and everything I know. My dad is stressed because he needs to find a private school job in the US but they dont have good benefits for kids. My parents say that I will make new friends but I am a introverted person and it is hard for me to make friends. My parents also say on top of that that most of my friendships wont last that long anyway. I dont want to go but I am forced to anyways by my parents because he is my grandpa. I dont even really know who he is. 

sorry if this is kinda ranty. I have just bottled this all up and I dont really know what to do with it.",1
"Hi Everyone, my dad has middle stage Alzheimer’s  and my mum is very near the end of her battle with glioblastoma, I would say days to weeks. Has anyone else dealt with a loved one with dementia losing their spouse? My dad continually forgets what’s wrong with my mum and assumes she’ll be on the mend soon. Watching him relearning she has a terminal illness over and over again is heartbreaking. Apart from the normal grieving that everyone goes through when losing a spouse or loved one, I’m worried we are going to see a big decline in him and wonder if it will be permanent. Does anyone have experience in this area?",1
"I have two parents I am the only one taking care of. I am their POA, Health Care Agent, and full time caregiver. 

My mom is on hospice with dementia and kidney failure. My father had end stage Parkinson’s, and we just found out he has lung cancer. He’s in rehab right now but will be returning home soon, presumably to hospice as well. 

I am chronically ill with severe illnesses that can be deadly, and I am disabled. I have had caregivers have to help me for the last 10 years until it came time to care for my parents, which I’ve been doing for years. 

My parents were severely abusive to me my whole life, but I try to put that aside because I can’t just leave them to suffer and die alone. Nursing homes are full and there’s no other options. 

I’ve given up my healthcare, finances, and social life to help them because no other family member will help. These family members who won’t help are never around, I barely know them, yet they are constantly making accusations against me of every type of abuse possible which means APS is always around. I’ve been nothing but kind to my parents and I don’t know why the family is doing this. 

I’m writing this because I’ve always been the type of person who can handle crises and be calm and fix things even in the worst circumstances, but I have not been able to do that lately. 

Since they have gone from sick to dying, my workload has increased to where I am working 48 hours at a time without eating, getting a few hours of sleep, even when I had Covid with a 104 temperature, then doing it all over again. It’s physical care, paperwork, phone calls, text, care coordination and so much more and it never ends. I am overworked to a point I never thought humans could even survive through.  

I am seeing a counselor and my doctor, both of whom said I am physically and emotionally incapable of continuing to care for them. But until someone else steps up, it is on me. 

I have been feeling very off. I am anxious and panicky all the time. I have tried a better sleep schedule but I can’t sleep for more than a few hours despite being so exhausted I can barely walk or keep my eyes open. I have had panic attacks (been given meds for that), cry at random times daily even though I rarely used to cry at all. 

I have nightmares when I do sleep that are horrifying. I’m so tired that I’m constantly  dizzy and feel like I’m seeing black spots in my vision and walking around in the twilight zone. 

My behavior is off.  I have acted out in embarrassing ways to friends that I love very much and I don’t know why. 

My physical health is very bad. I’m not eating a lot and am not hungry even when my stomach is growling. My emotions are all over the place. I am not myself at all and barely remember what “normal” used to be like. 

Overall the best way I can explain how I feel is by this movie clip : https://youtu.be/7ihp94EnKp0

Word for word what he said is how I feel. It scares me because I’ve never experienced this before. 

It has gotten to a point where I’m isolated and feel I’m having some sort of breakdown. Or is this normal? 

I have reached out to every available resource including social workers etc. oh there are no caregiving support groups here because all of the hospice is and caregiving agencies are short staffed and cannot host them.

I don’t know what to do. I am writing here wondering if anyone has experienced this before. And any suggestions on how to get back to some kind of normality or is this not possible? 

When they pass away, I will be dealing with a lot of grief and also relief and other mixed emotions as well as losing the financial support that has kept me living independently while I have been disabled, and so sick - and inheriting a house that I have no idea what to do with, as well as being the only one in charge of putting affairs in order. I fear that this will be an even worse time and I don’t know how I can handle anymore.

Any suggestions or anyone who has gone through this please let me know. I swear I feel like if I could just sleep normally I could at least handle things but it just isn’t happening even with medication.

"...but, nevertheless, exhausted and depleted from being my wife's caregiver.

She's in that netherland; confused and unable to hold onto to even a simple thought, but can still drive, find her way to church, grocery store and some other familiar places.  My psychiatrist agrees that it's a matter of waiting until the next event or decline occurs.  Yes, assisted living is the place, but my wife would want me to be with her and I don't want to move into a senior living community.

"I figured this subreddit might have some advice for me. My neighbour is an elderly lady named Barbara and she has dementia. Unfortunately from what I've heard, most of her family has passed away and she only has one family member left who is doing the absolute bare minimum to help her. I don't know how bad it is but her condition has rapidly declined over the year I've been her neighbour and I believe she's at the point where she shouldn't be living alone. She doesn't remember that she lives in her apartment, she thinks I'm her sister, she thinks her family abandoned her but in reality she's just outlived all of them. She's been found wandering around outside the building at midnight, thankfully wearing proper attire to deal with Canadian winter, but I'm worried that one day she's going to go out there in her nightgown or forget her keys and end up freezing to death. 

Are there any resources I can contact to get her some better help or anyone I can report her worsening condition to? We live in Oakville, Ontario if that helps. 

Are there any exercises I can get brushed up on to help ground her when she's having a hard time with her surroundings? I don't want to do or say the wrong thing and make it worse for her. 

Thank you for taking the time to read and for anyone who offers any info or suggestions.",1
"Hello,

My father is 65 with DLB and was moved to memory care at the start of the year (been there a little under a month). My mother has a home about 15 minutes away and has visited every day up until Thursday this week, since she had to travel to her own mother's funeral. I live several states away at the moment, but I flew over to make sure somebody is with him and spending time with him, since I can't stand knowing how lonely he is.

Now some backstory, when we first moved into the care facility he was not happy. He stated feelings of abandonment and wanting to go back to his home. I've read this is fairly common when you move to memory care, and generally after a month or two the patients get acclimated and make some friends, etc.

The issue is, every time I've visited since Thursday the first words out of his mouth are ""Where is my wife"" usually followed by an angry tirade about how he got dumped there and nobody visits. It breaks my heart since I know that's his reality, even if it's not true. I've tried assuring him that my mom is just away for a couple days and will be back to visiting regularly on Monday, but he just continues about how he's sure that's not the case since even when she wasn't traveling she ""never visits him"".

I'm generally good with redirecting or playing along, but this is one of those cases where I can't just say ""yep you're right she never visits!"" because I know she does every single day she can, and I don't want to feed any resentment between them.

One of the main reasons for putting him in memory care was so that my mother could focus less on being his caregiver, and more on being his wife. I just hate knowing that my mom is going to come back from her own mothers funeral and be berated by my father for ""abandoning him"" even though she's been very on-top of stuff.

Any tips for assuring him his wife didn't abandon him and does in fact visit every day?",1
"I have a resident in my AL neighborhood who has an obsession with calling her son, because she thinks he’s dead. (He’s very much alive and visits when he can). However she does have mid stage Alzheimer’s. It literally happens everyday she comes up to me saying “my son is dead my son is dead.” Or she thinks he’s alive and will not stop trying to call this man. Most of my redirecting can help sometimes. In regards to distracting her with a snack, a drink, or activity. But I have an idea that I’m not sure if others have tried. B/c she always thinks her son is dead either have him write her letters we can give her, like maybe in a rotation? Or we video him for his mom? Any experience in that? Would that be a better redirection in helping her calm down? Any help is greatly appreciated, because when I suggested our memory neighborhood (not necessarily ours, but others of the company my idea was shot down.)",1
"My mom has had dementia for about 18 months. It got to the point where I had to arranged for a caregiver to spend 6 hours a day with her. It became progressively worse, and I was advised to find a memory care facility. Unfortunately she never got comfortable there, and was considered to be problematic. I found it confusing that they would call to tell me she couldn't be controlled, several times a month, when I though that's why she was there, and it's part of the disease.

She had a few falls, the last one being exactly three weeks ago. She went into A-fib while in the ER so they admitted her to the ICU. She began going down hill fast. I arranged for hospice care and the doctors wanted to send her back to the memory care facility, but with hospice care. They wanted to send her last Friday, but I begged them to let her go to the hospice facility since I had a bad feeling about how she was acting. She went into the hospice care facility last Friday, and she was put on Xanax and morphine because she was very agitated and having severe anxiety attacks. She had a moment  where she was calm and lucid so I had a chance to hold her hand and tell her I loved her.

She died yesterday morning. I'm heartbroken, but glad that she's not suffering. Dementia is a terrible disease. I wish anyone dealing with a family member all the best. Be strong, or it will wear you down.",1
"Can we get this started again? Sometimes it helps to laugh it off. 

Talked to my mom on Facetime today (my dad was with her and did the dialing).  

My mom started off saying some nice things: your hair looks great (i'd just gotten out of the shower and it was wet, but whatever), your cheeks are so pink, etc.  Then she follows it up with ""You really just need to get a new nose and that would make everything better!""  

Then a few minutes later, she came up with ""Is that you on the screen? It just looks like a face on a trash bag pulled out of a potty!""  

Thanks Mom. My dad was laughing so hard he nearly fell off his chair. Talk about a conversation-ender!",1
"He (73) had a massive stroke 5 years ago and now pretty much has dementia and lives in a nursing home and is paralysed on one side. I was 19 when, essentially, I lost my father.

His personality completely changed. He is so mean to my mother and blames her for being a shit wife because essentially, she hates him now. Hates him for ruining her life and sucking all her money dry for caring for him (paying for nursing home) when if she could, she’d divorce him and never look back. That’s how much he changed into another person.

I don’t really like to visit him, I hate seeing him so weak and defeated and unhealthy, and hate how he makes my mother’s life miserable.

The biggest issue we face is he tries to come up with the wildest ways to spend money. Just last night he called a computer repair guy to come to the nursing home, fix his laptop he hasn’t used in years and set him up an email account. The guy finished and obviously expected to be paid. My dad directed him to my mother over the phone since he HAS NO MONEY OBVIOUSLY. The bill was $450. She was furious and just couldn’t understand why he does things like this without consulting her and realising she can’t pay for all these things. The tech guy wouldn’t leave until being paid and eventually we called his boss to try and explain but they were essentially like bad luck. He called and we did the work, so pay up. Things like this is why she hates him (I’m sure of it). I don’t even think she ever really loved him even before he was sick.

He does this sort of thing all the time. It’s like he makes it his life’s mission to make our lives hard. I know his situation, but I’m asking for help on how to deal with this.

We are at our wits end. We obviously haven’t given him any cash or credit cards but he still somehow finds ways to do it, such as the situation above.

Any advice is appreciated.",1

"My husband, 83, is in rehab at the moment, but making no progress and imo, deteriorating. I'm 70 and have been his caregiver since his mobility declined five years ago. I should preface this by saying my husband, whom I love, has been a terrible communicator our whole marriage--he is introverted, avoidant, deceptive, never says anything directly if there is a roundabout way to make you guess what he means. He frustrated his partner (architects) and had many girlfriends, but no marriage until 53, to me. I am c-ptsd due to child abuse and although he was very good to me during our marriage, his communication verged on gaslighting and passive-aggression to the point that if it was financially feasible, I'd have divorced him.  He has been declining awhile but of course I was in denial and the above made it more difficult for me to see the decline. Now at rehab he is saying things like ""I don't want to live anymore,"" ""I'm in Cuba,"" and today, ""I don't know where I am--they are moving me around.""  Then he denied to his nurse that he'd said it to me.  How do I get a dementia diagnosis without hurting his feelings?  I've requested his pcp to see him and I hope she doesn't want him to see a specialist. In his weakened condition (had pneumonia, can no longer use walker) it will be so hard for him. I love him dearly but the accumulated stress is affecting me badly. Before he was hospitalized I felt I was having a nervous breakdown, now I've had two utis and two antibiotics.  It's a race which one of us collapses first, imo.",1
My client lately has been forgetting how to use the heater. She used to be able to use it all the time with no help. But lately she won’t even mess with it and waits till I’m there to have me adjust the temperature. She is either too cold or too hot. I’ll turn the heater up a couple degrees and she is burning up. So I’ll turn it down and now she’s freezing. I leave it on the heater because the cooler is too much for her I’ve noticed. Does this relate to her condition getting worse?,1

"***Based in the UK***

Sadly, my uncle is in complete denial, of his condition. he just says ""I remember, what I need to remember"". He has really bad memory, mixes up days and times, and no idea about what is going  in the world right now.  

So, this happened a few days ago, he was trying to pump air into his tire, it seems he let all of the air out of the tire, trying to put the air pump on the tire but it went completely flat. Another driver beeped at him, shouting abuse. He then just drove off, my poor uncle became very upset.

Thank goodness, another driver went to to help my uncle, and stayed with him. He found my uncle's mobile phone, and called my mum.  

My dad found my uncle, at the petrol station. and thanked the other driver, for staying with him. My dad had to call a tow-truck to collect my uncle's car.  

We did discover, that he had been driving without insurance for months.  

At the moment, he knows his car is on a private driveway, and we have tried to explain to him, that a mechanic will looking at his car in a few weeks, the car garage we use, is at the moment very busy with other cars. He has seemed to accept this (which is true).

We really feel this will just get worse, and one day he will hit another car, a cyclist or even a child on a crossing.

It's causing arguments within the family, and not sure what to do. Do we call the DVLA, and explain the situation? The problem is, if my uncle found out that we went behind his back, he would never forgive us.

Or do we explain that we feel he can't drive anymore? But then again, he won't talk to to use anymore, and that would break my mum's heart.  

Any help and suggestions will be appreciated.",1
"Hi Everyone,  Thank you so much for this group, you all have always been so helpful!!  

My mom was diagnosed with vascular and alzheimer's last year and since her diagnosis it feels like she is moving backwards at warp speed.  

Something lately we are struggling with is her clothing. She wears one outfit (long-jons, jersey ,scarf, pants and boots) , does not change or wash it and she sleeps in it as well. Shes not bothered about changing and when she showers she changes right back into it. We have tried preparing outfits for her as well as her PJ's, but she still puts this outfit on.  

Do you have any suggestions on how to deal with this? Or just leave it as is and try and stock up her wardrobe with the same items of clothing?  This is really distressing my dad because she was always so meticulous and well dressed. It is also currently the middle of a VERY hot summer in our country and we are really concerned about her overheating.  

As always thank you for your help

"My mom and I have been spending lot of time with my grandma for the last year ish after my aunt died to keep her company. She has gradually needed a bit more help taking care of herself, and got a probable dementia diagnosis this week. We will likely be her caregivers when that time comes.

I’m going to be talking to the 3 of them about getting living wills, life insurance, etc etc soon, but Jesus. It just hit me today my parents are old. They’re both still well, and trying (successfully!) to get their health on track. 

I know worrying about it won’t help anything, but I can’t help but get paranoid every time they repeat a story or misplace something. (I’ve long suspected they both have ADHD like I do for years, so this will be semi often) 
 
I’ve dealt with some major issues in the last few years that have kept me still pretty dependent on them unfortunately, so that just adds more fuel to my worry. And obviously, I know I won’t always need so much of their help. 

Anyway, just needed to vent. I hope you all have the best days you can, and thank you so much for those of you loving and caring for people with dementia.",1
"My boyfriend's dad has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's last year and has been living with my bf since last June, as my bf and his brother feel it isn't safe for him to live alone anymore. The dad seems to be in the mid stages - a lot of confusion but mostly with it somewhat.

I am going absolutely insane!!!!!  How do you deal with the anger and frustration? My bf's whole day ends up revolving around his dad. He makes him breakfast, then his dad hints he wants a coffee at 11 - bf makes him coffee and cake. Then it's lunch - my bf makes him lunch. Then his dad goes for a jog, comes back hungry, my bf starts cooking dinner for him. Then goes back to work until 10pm and then attempts to sleep. This is all on a good day, if there isn't stuff to sort - like his dad has lost something or has found an old bill to pay. I'm going insane, he feels like his dad's servant at this stage. The only quality time we get is in the evening once the dad has gone to bed, if my bf isn't trying to catch up on work, otherwise our entire day is dictated by his dad.

We tried having the brother take the dad for breaks but they gave completely fallen out. My bf is now in the process of trying to find his dad somewhere to live and a carer. We're in the UK, so there's a big carer shortage at the moment, so we're looking privately (even that has a wait!!). Housing wise they're looking at buying somewhere a carer could potentially live in when he gets bad, though they're also considering renting (but the dad isn't aware, he just wants to buy. Another frustration is trying to make sure the dad is on board with everything we plan, which takes forever, so trying to convince him to rent if the house sale falls through is going to be long!).

How long does all this sorting out take!? I'm getting to the end of my tether - it always feels like we're almost there and suddenly another few months have gone and we're still at square one :(",1
"Mom is not sleeping the whole night, meaning my father and I don't, either. But we can't sleep during the day like she does.

She power naps 30 min in her chair in front of the TV.

Stayed up all night trying to convince her to take a shower as she soiled herself very badly.

She went to the toilet about 25 times at night, more during the day.

At the same time she walks around trying to ""do things"" that she thinks are chores around the house. I get it, we need to feel we all do that.

Spent the night taking food that isn't food out of her hands and also food like chips out of her pockets. There are snacks on the table.

Offered her a plate of proper hot food several times, she says she isn't hungry at the same time is hunting around for food.

She is legally blind and close to deaf. (Refuses to wear hearing aid).

No, we don't have government help yet because of certain things (stubborn father) that I won't go into.

At some point in time (now is way past it) one should say it's too much for two people.

I've spent 2 years trying to do my certificate I need for a better job. Just paid for another year, so fingers crossed.

She's in the shower now at long last and it's midday the next day already.

She is convinced her condition is perfect apart from her legs being bad. That her memory is perfect and that she does everything about the house all by herself.

She is convinced my father and I are conspiring to do her harm and that we do nothing for her at all.

Oh, and I locked the kitchen at 5 AM this morning and that only brought huge thumping on the door.

Not going to bother asking her if she's hungry when she's out of the shower (one thing she is still able to do herself, thank goodness!). I'll just say food is on the table.",1
"Hi everyone, my Dad 78M- was diagnosed with mild vascular dementia in August 2022.  He had 2 strokes a few years ago that we didn’t even know about.  He has circulation issues in his right leg and his foot turned purple so the doctor put a stent in his thigh on December 15 hoping it would help blood flow to the foot.  Since then he’s been in a state of delirium, some days better than others.  At the beginning of December, he was cooking his own breakfast with my mothers supervision, now he has incontinence and when he talks, he barely makes sense.  He’s in his own world.  This week the doctor told us the foot has to come off, it’s going to become septic.  They want to cut his leg off at the thigh - he has decent blood flow to his knee area but no lower.    We really don’t have a choice as he’s in pain and the foots turning black.  Our fear is that he will never come out of the delirium and are we just prolonging his pain.  Has anyone had this experience with a loved one?  Do they come back from the delirium?",1
"I am really struggling. My dad is in, what I would guess, the moderate stage of dementia. He has been living in an assisted living facility for the past 2.5 years. Last summer he took a turn for the worse and we thought the end was near. He qualified for hospice care after two brief hospital stays. However, physically he has rebounded and was discharged from hospice and is now in palliative care with the same agency. 

As many of you know, his care is very expensive. He has almost burned through his entire savings. In order to prepare for the inevitable fact that he is going to outlive his money we have begun the process of looking at qualifying him for Medicaid. As many of you also know, that process is daunting to say the least. It looks like the best avenue is to get him into a skilled nursing facility (assuming he qualifies which is not a definite)

Last week I went to visit a place that has a high rating (according to both professionals and the medicare website) and it felt very safe and comfortable. It seemed well staffed and the residents all looked like their needs were being met. The downside is that he will have to share a very small room.

My dad has been self-isolating for about the last 30 years. Long before his dementia diagnosis in 2015. The one thing he asked when I moved him out of his house 3 years ago is that I make sure that he never has to share a room with someone. I told him I would do my best. When I talked to the MemoryCare doctor about this a couple of years ago (anticipating that this day would come) she told me that by the time this day came he would not be cognitively aware enough to care anymore. I don't think that is the case. He obviously has good days and bad days. He thinks he has been in his current place for 1 week (versus the 2.5 year reality). When I visited him a couple of days ago he was sure to tell me that he likes his room and has everything he needs.

I am feeling extremely guilty and anxiety ridden. I know that I am in no position to take care of him. I do think he is going to be miserable. I guess I am wondering if anyone else has found themselves in a similar situation and how you were able to handle it? Any suggestions? Also, I have found one place where he might be able to get his own room but it only has 1 star and has terrible reviews so it is not really an option.",1
"Was venting with a cousin earlier about some awful family actions. We’re both in late 30s, my father has dementia, hers doesn’t, but is being moved to assisted living (with his cognition and consent)

And we both kind of went, I don’t know how people less fortunate do this, because it’s still a huge struggle for us in each situation. If there wasn’t financial options, the time it takes, just providing all the care, being savvy enough to navigate things

For everyone who is struggling, fortunate or not, we’re all thinking of you. You’re doing the best you can, and every little bit helps you, your loved one, and everyone who cares. Every success, no matter how many stumbling blocks helps",1
"Six months ago, my dad's wife of 20+ years sent him across the country to live with me temporarily while she went through chemo treatments for cancer. I was good with that - she needed time to rest and I cared about her health, too. My dad has lewy body and requires a lot of attention. After his wife was done with treatment, she told him that she still didn't want him to come home and that he should stay with me from now on. Yesterday a lawyer sent a letter to our house to notify my dad that she's filing for divorce.  I haven't told my dad yet but plan to on Saturday so I can hire an attorney first and then focus on my dad all weekend. 

Has anyone else dealt with divorce & dementia? How was your LO able to handle it? I have no idea what this is going to do to my dad and I am feeling pretty anxious about having to navigate this for him. I have a POA and they have a pre-nup and his wife has her own money/has always been very generous, so I am not concerned about the financial aspect, just the emotional/logistical aspect. His stuff is still in their house on the other side of the country. She says that she still cares about all of us and wants to be in our lives, but I don't quite understand her vision for how that would work.",1
"I am very frustrated. My grandpa's memory hasn't ever really been great but since his last sibling died two years ago, it's gotten much worse.

I live 45 minutes away from him and have a toddler so I don't get to go see him as often as I'd like to. My sister still lives in town and helps as much as she can. She's started keeping a journal of all of my grandpa's episodes. 

She recently went with him to his primary care provider to see if he could diagnose or at least refer my grandpa to a specialist after seeing him and hearing about his episodes. She made a point  to express her concerns to this doctor. He asked my grandpa 4 questions and said he was fine, maybe showing early signs of dementia. Refused to refer him to anywhere else. 

This is where the frustration comes in. My grandpa is seeing people in his house. I have personally witnessed this once while visiting. 

I don't know how to help. I don't know where to take him. Does he need a referral for a neurologist? Can an urgent care make that kind of referral? I don't know what to do or who to ask. 

My mom recently had a kidney removed so her lack of involvement would be excused right now. If it weren't for the fact that she hasn't done anything before. I don't know if she's in denial or what, but she has to do something because my sister and I clearly don't know what to do. 

I don't know what I need to do....",1
"Hello, i dont know what to do. It seems like my grandpa doesnt remember me, forgets about me or straight up ignores me. He seems to remember everyone or maybe mess up names a little bit but nothing like dont knowing who i am. How do i deal with this? Is there a way to make him remember and knows who am i?",1
"My 86 year old grandma with dementia has been living with me for a little over a month. Despite her severe short term memory deficits she's still pretty sharp, and even providers are sometimes stumped by how well she 'preforms' when she's under observation. She isn't able to be home because of her lack of memory, but also because she has osteoarthritis and balance issues. She just also got a diagnosis of Congestive Heart Failure, which is even more complicated to manage than i expected. She needs a LOT of physical assistance including a walker, and lift help to get out of chairs. Right now I'm providing 24/7 care solo, and also doing the best I can to meet her mental needs as well.

Lately she's been bringing up going home. Now, the biggest reason is because she has been taking care of my alcoholic uncle for 20+years. She used to buy his food, cook for him, do laundry, dishes, file taxes, etc. He did NOTHING to take care of himself. Now he's alone in her home (long story; we're working with a lawyer) and she's worrying about him. She has been in and out of the hospital and nursing home the last 2 months, and the first visit he had with her since her hospitalization was last weekend. 

I'll be working from home and she'll bring up about how she needs to get going. How she needs to check in on her son, and get back home. But I think she'll be living here until she gets to the point where she needs memory care. I'm struggling with what to say to her. She's still so sharp, and usually sees right through any bs answer I give. I'm ok with little white lies, when they're for her own good. But this is such a touchy subject for us, I just don't know how to handle it. Should I just distract her? Or acknowledge her question and move on?",1
My grandma is 80 years old (I am in high school). Before her dementia diagnosis about 6 years ago she was an amazing person I loved being around her. She has lived with me and my family for about 11 years now. I love her to death and I feel terrible writing this I just need a space to let my emotions out. Now that her dementia has progressed and gotten more severe she has needed a lot more care. My mother is always occupied taking care of her while still doing her job as a teacher. She needs so much care and I feel that it’s so hard for my mother to ever catch a break. Also she is very head strong so when we try to redirect her she will not give in whatsoever and it can be very frustrating. She also will put away dirty dishes and now every time before we want to cook or eat we need to wash and dry every dish. When we do our laundry and the laundry load will finish she will put/hide clothes around our house. It’s very hard adjusting to her dementia I love her so much but at times I can not help but just feel resentment towards her because of how we have to care for her I understand that none of this is her fault at all and I love her and spend time with her just needed to let my emotions out.,1
My dad is still pretty functional despite having moderate dementia but I can’t get him to shower or brush his teeth anymore. He’s not at the point where he needs someone to do it for him he just doesn’t want to do it? He keeps saying he’s retired so he doesn’t have to do anything he doesn’t want to. I don’t want to fight and force him but he just went a week without showering just because he didn’t want to. I have seen him go into the bathroom and just run the water then lie to me that he showered or brushed his teeth. What the hell do I do?,1
"Background: my siblings and I (44F) noticed my mom (76) had started repeating herself quite a bit and her short term memory was declining about 5 years ago, pre-covid. Talked to her and my dad several times about having her PCP do the typical memory screening to see if it was in the realm of normal. She refused, or would just say oh she forgot to mention it at her appointment. Then covid hit and my parents were pretty isolated for close to two years. The decline in my mother's memory was noticeable in that time and seeing her in person after two years was really, really difficult. She is still mostly able to take care of the day to day but she's not showering much and is hoarding food. She repeats herself constantly and her short term memory is non-existent. 

My dad finally colluded with her PCP to get her to come in for bloodwork and they did the memory screening then. Her score was not great and she was referred to a neurologist for an MRI. It took about 6 months to get an appointment. Had the MRI, got the written results, and she had to wait several more months to actually see the neurologist to discuss them. I read the report, there were some concerning things on it (moderate volume loss, MTA scores of 3, ERiCA scores of 2, evidence of old infarct). The neurologist told her there wasn't a whole lot they could do, but referred her to an in-depth memory assessment, and that's where she got the mild cognitive impairment diagnosis (which also took several months to get done). The clinical psychologists who did her assessment were very clear in their findings that the next step would be to determine the medical cause. She had a follow up with the neurologist who did exactly nothing to determine the cause but put her on an early Alzheimer's drug. I convinced my dad to ask for a referral for her to a specialized network for memory diagnostics and care. Her PCP's response was ""she already has a diagnosis, what is the point of this referral?""

Am I missing something? It seems like they're just shrugging their shoulders and giving up before we have any real answers. We know she has mild cognitive impairment, that has been clear for some time. Why are her doctors not at all interested in actually determining the cause? From what I've read, her prognosis is very much dependent on what type of dementia it is.",1
"My mother with dementia (61) has no notion of time or patience and wants everything done at the very second. If I have to take her somewhere and we are waiting for a taxi, she needs to get into the car AT THE VERY MOMENT, even if it hasn't come to pick us up yet. If we are inside a car, she can try to get out of a moving car. Same with showers: she constantly tries to get out of the shower with soap still on her and repeats ""it's done! let me out!""; you have to fight and retain her to be able to wash and rinse properly. Caregivers come twice a day to prepare her meals and give her meds, and she sits in the kitchen and repeats the same phrase ""let me eat this! let me eat this!"" (even though she eats enough all day) no matter how many times they explain that it is not ready, uncooked or still boiling hot. She tries to grab bowls with raw pancake dough or boiling pots.

While this behavior was mostly repeating the same phrase over and over till last week, now she also started to scream and cry if she has to wait 5 minutes. Always in a rush. Basically like a toddler.

She is on 5mg/day Haloperidol and 300mg/day Seroquel (Quetiapine). Do you think medication increase is necessary or do you know any tricks?

(I also noticed that all this mantality of her was kinda present before dementia, when she was younger, but in a much milder way, like a low-key anxiety. Now it is much more unreasonable)",1
"Hello all you experienced folks,

My dad (83, with Alzheimer's) has recently had caregivers start to come in a few days a week. They are there to help with dressing, bathing, and minor household help. He insisted he didn't need any help, of course. My disabled mum is still alive/lives there but somehow doesn't qualify for assistance (grumble); having someone assist with dad helps tremendously.

He has in the past set his beard on fire trying to light his pipe, neglects his hygiene and food, will not take his diabetes meds, refuses to drink so he won't have to get up to pee, etc., so it seems that he really does need the external assistance. He has a once-a-week senior companion who takes him out for lunch, errands, etc (they used to go fishing or hiking, but dad can't do those anymore). Senior Companion has expressed significant concern about dad's competence and leaving him alone.

A month into the caregiver arrangements, they carers have decided that dad doesn't in fact need much help. He can be quite charming and talkative when he has to be (used to work in sales) but once they leave he becomes uncooperative, struggles with the stairs, looks at a plate of food with confusion, etc.

My question is this: Is this typical with new caregiver relationships? Is my dad being stubborn? Or just trying to prove that he can still be independent? (My own suspicion is weaponized incompetence, something he was **highly** skilled at before the dx).",1
"My mom moved into assisted-living on Saturday. After many hours of explaining to her why she needs to be there and where she is, we left her (very distraught) in the dining room to have dinner. I called her in her room after dinner, and she seemed to be in a better mood. I visited her the next morning (Sunday) and she seem to be adjusting well. She was in a good mood, and we left around lunchtime, where she willingly walked into the dining room and sat down. As I was leaving, the head nurse grabbed me to talk. She said on the first night, my mom left the room frequently and was asking to go home. She needed to be redirected over and over again. She suggested Xanax or Ativan to help my mom sleep. I told her I was not comfortable with that and suggested over-the-counter alternatives. They gave her melatonin the second night, and she only woke up once on the second night. 

The next day, Monday, I went to visit my mom in the afternoon. She was crying and upset when we tried to leave and wanted to come home. I spoke with a different nurse who said that my mom was walking around the building with her dog (they allow pets) all day and seems very anxious. She again suggested the use of Xanax or Ativan. I again declined and told this nurse that my mom is very active and I don’t feel comfortable giving her narcotics when we are still in the process of getting officially diagnosed by a neurologist. I told the nurse I would speak to the neurologist on Thursday about the use of these medications and get back to her. I met with one of the community directors after the nurse and discussed how my mom was progressing. Her take was that it’s only her second day and that she will adjust. She also gently suggested that I don’t visit every day. It wasn’t like she was telling me I wasn’t allowed to, but sort of suggested that maybe my mom would adjust better without me there every day.

My mom is generally a very hyperactive person and always has been. She does not sit still and stare at movies all day like the rest of the residents. My mom is also younger, at 67, while the average age is 80s.  It is only her third day there, and I have really mixed feelings about the push for narcotics and suggestion that I don’t visit as much. I obviously do not want to start a war with the staff, but the subtext here is that they are unwilling or unable to deal with someone who needs to be entertained and kept busy. My mom is in the weird in between phase of dementia, where she isn’t so bad that she needs memory care, but she isn’t eligible for independent living either. 

I also feel skeptical about the fact that they try to suggest that I should not be visiting every day. I certainly do not want to visit her every day, but I’m feeling like I should see her most days. After all, I moved her to this place, because it is only 10 minutes from my house. I don’t want her to feel abandoned in there, and I also want to keep tabs on whether she seems drugged out or not. As an aside, this facility is one of the most upscale facilities in our area, it is very expensive, and has a good reputation. I don’t think that there’s a nefarious intent here, but I just feel worried that maybe she is a little too much for their staff to handle. Has anyone had any similar experiences?",1
"Since we put my 70+-year-old mom in dementia care, she calls her out-of-state sisters daily and cries to be discharged. My aunties then message or call me to persuade me to keep her at my home,  despite having seen my mom's attempt to run away whenever she is not at her own home and other memory-related lapses. They do this as they think since my sister admitted my mom in NH, I would be willing to home her since my sister is not. They refuse to accept that after a particular stage, a dementia patient cannot be taken care of at home and needs specialized care. Due to this, there is a lot of friction now with my aunts, and my relationship has become very strained with them. Do relatives ever understand this disease and what it takes from the patient and the close family? How did you make them accept that this is the best and safest decision for your parent?

  
TLDR: I have a full-time job and family responsibilities. I have visited my mom's NH, and the food and facilities are all good there, but she is constantly calling and complaining that she doesn't get decent food.  Also, my brother, who suffers from schizophrenia, is at the same NH since it's the only one that was willing to accept both of them together. He has really improved under the supervision and leads a normal life there. Due to this he is able to give companionship and takes care of my mom which he wasn't doing when home alone.",1
"I recently brought my mom out to where I live (about 300 miles from her) to look at assisted living places. It became apparent during her stay that she is far worse than I knew. She didn’t shower, brush her teeth or change her clothes in four days. When I suggested she do so, she told me to mind my own business. She also repeatedly asked me how I knew her and didn’t believe it when I said I was her daughter (I am her only child). She is refusing to think about memory care/assisted living. I returned her to her home yesterday and when I called her later, she said “some woman took me on a trip and tried to lock me up.” I don’t know how to proceed. I have her POA, but how do I get her the care she needs if she refuses all help and doesn’t even know me anymore?",1
"gettin straight to da point, he literally climbed out his window (bottom floor, on the ground) and somehow walked all the way down to the neighbors house at night all without falling, severely hurting himself, or using his cane. Can somebody pls explain how an 82 year old wit dementia successfully did this",1
"My mom has cognitive decline and is in early (?) stages of dementia. For reference, I've had to take away her banking and credit cards as she was buying strange subscription services, talking to scammers, etc. She can't drive. Barely can walk. But she 'showtimes' well for the doctor.

My question is she sleeps ALL the time. Usually till 2 or 3pm. Goes to bed about 8pm.  Sits in a chair all day. Prefers a diaper so she doesn't have to walk to toilet. Is spacey and has really nothing to say except for random weird stuff, like coming up with the idea to pay for a new roof for a distant family member she hasn't spoken to in years who as far as we know has a perfectly fine roof.  

She has no concept of clean or dirty anymore in her clothing or body.  

What I'm wondering most about is the sleep. Is this normal? Am I going to find her dead? Should I call her doctor?",1
"In my neighborhood, there's a man who has to be at least 80 or so, but at times, he would yell out of his second floor window at late hours for no reason. He even accused the neighborhood kids for causing a ruckus when they were just playing basketball in a culdesac on the weekends. 

I suspect he has some sort of dementia or maybe an emotional disability. What disturbs me is that I've noticed no one coming to visit him, like family or friends and he lives alone. Who would be a good contact so that this lonely old man can be checked on and maybe receive some medical help if necessary?",1
"Both of my dad’s older sisters were diagnosed with MCI in their 60’s that has progressed over the years. My dad is 65 and not currently showing any signs of cognitive impairment. Neither of their parents had any form of dementia, nor has anyone in their lineage that they knew of.

I am curious, what is known about the causes of dementia? Is it likely that my two aunts both have some heritable trait that caused this? Could it have been some kind of environmental exposure they both shared? Or is it likely just a coincidence? Is my dad’s risk of developing some sort of cognitive impairment higher because of this family history? Is mine higher?

Editing to add I was just reminded that their paternal grandmother had dementia in her 80’s, so not “early onset” like theirs but she did have dementia. Also their mother (my grandmother) developed it at 92.",1
"My daughter heard my mother fall this morning at 4am. She woke me up & ran downstairs, it was apparent she had fallen hard. Ambulance took us to the hospital where through xrays & ct scans, she has a broken hip  and broken shoulder. Our hospital was slammed, she didn’t get a bed til 6pm. She was an admit to the hospital’s inpatient hospice. I know logically, she is in safer hands that I can no longer provide, and she will most likely die in the hospital, there is a deafening silence in my home. It’s sad. I know she’s confused and afraid, and they don’t know what she eats. Very difficult day.",1
"My grandmother is 97. She’s got obvious dementia and forgetfulness and irritability.  I’m figuring her mental timeline is back to the 60s at this point.  She has been staying with us for safety concerns (meds, falls, eating, etc).  Since shes been with us, it’s become very obvious that she’s got some obsession with her teeth and gums.  She always uses a toothpick after meals years ago- now she always has one and scratches and picks at her teeth constantly. She asked my mom to buy her a HARD toothbrush.  She (said) she was recently at the dentist (before we got her into our home) and reported the dentist said everything was fine. (Still want to check this out- she’s got horrible time recollection).  When she doesn’t have a tooth pick, she’s got her fingers in her mouth. Can’t tell if she’s chewing on dead skin on fingers, her nails, pushing her lips into her mouth and chewing on them, or if she’s picking her teeth with her fingers.  The smacking and chewing and sucking is constant.  What is this called? I’ve found it called several things.  How can we get her to stop before she gives her self an oral infection or starts getting sick from germs on her hands?? She also has decreased appetite and wrinkles her nose at nearly everything we give her to eat. She is also steadily losing weight. She loses about 10-20 lbs a year over the last 4 years. She’s now down to 116! Any suggestions?",1
"I believe the time has come to move my father into memory care. The complicating factor is he has been heavily resistant to any form of help or change every step of the way. I have gently broached the idea of moving to a place with more people and things to do and he seemed receptive but I also don't believe he really understood what I was suggesting.

I will of course work with the facility and explain my concerns to get assistance. I am also his POA, FWIW. But I am dreading this day because it's hard to imagine this working out smoothly. I believe I will have to take him there under some pretense and I assume he will demand to go home. I will have to leave him like leaving a child on first day of school. Then I am not sure what happens, but it pains me to think about how he will react and for how long (days? weeks?). I am certain this move is ultimately needed for his sake so I must move forward. 

Advice? Thoughts? Past experiences to share?",1
"Her dementia is getting pretty bad, I’d say she is in mod late stage dementia. But she has consistently had very little appetite the past 10 years. Of course this doesn’t help as you need proper nutrition and more protein intake as you age. I’m assuming part of the reason could be because she has some gut issues as well as the change in taste associated with cognitive decline. 

She’s taking some standard supplements like magnesium, d3, b complex, and b12. She absolutely hates eating most protein foods like eggs and meats. She HATES ensure drinks or anything like it. I’m concerned for her nutrition, although she did get some blood tests and they were all good (with the exception of her fasting glucose so I’ll see to it that she cuts out refined carbs). She does seem to like sweet foods, which isn’t good for her blood sugar! 

I know supplements can’t help with cognition much but I’m very sure that if she had a proper diet she would be able to have more energy and possibly be a little more cohesive. Any suggestions on how I can get her to eat? I’ve tried taking very frequent breaks and encouraging her to eat every 15 minutes since she forgets that she ate recently. But she eats TINY bites and usually throws the food out when she thinks I’m not looking lol. 

P.S. not a caretaker, my other grandparent takes care of her, but I’m going to have to visit her more often to help her with this issue

Thanks!",1
"
My mom (68) is in the early-mid stages of vascular dementia and currently lives alone in an “independent living” retirement community. They provide 3 meals a day every day but Sunday, when my sister and I step in to make sure she’s fed. Nursing staff is only there periodically/inconsistently, and I have med management set up through a third party.

Her short-term memory is near nonexistent, and she’ll often get disoriented and confused and develop harmless delusions. We’re at the point where I’m managing her finances, and there are days she can barely work her phone. I’m worried the level of care she’s (not) receiving in this community will start to become an issue sooner than later.

I’ve found a great community nearby that has care that scales up all the way to memory care so that folks can “age in place.” It seems really wonderful and top of the line, and my mom has been receptive to discussing it—though it doesn’t seem to connect that she’d be moving there full-time.

The issue is she’s really made a home for herself in her current community. She’s always been a bit of recluse, but the insular nature of the community seems to have brought her out of her shell. She even has a boyfriend—her first  partner in almost 20 years! Ironically, she seems the happiest I’ve seen her in a while, and the concept of yanking her away from this seems cruel, especially because I know the transition period to a new environment will be very difficult for her.

Looking for any word of advice here. I believe a move to higher care might be inevitable, but I have no idea how to manage this transition and overcome the guilt associated with it. Is it time to just rip the bandaid?",1
"Hi everyone,

I'm hoping people who have been through some similar situations might have some tips on getting my father, who has dementia, to move out of his home.  There doesn't seem to be much by way of resources for this online beyond somewhat trite suggestions to have frank conversations early (we tried this to no avail).

By way of background, his condition is advancing, but he's still reasonably cognisant of who familiar people are.  He doesn't seem to be able to either plan activities, remember less frequently accessed memories (such as his deceased mother's name), or get around without a cane and accessible routes.

He's currently being cared for by his wife, who is still pretty mentally and physically able but they are a long way from support from family and it's all getting too hard for her.  She wants to move to be closer to adult children so that she has better support, but he's steadfastly refusing to move.

He even says he will stay there and live by himself, which he's probably not capable of doing any more.  For instance, he doesn't do any cooking or cleaning, has had his drivers license taken away, can't walk to public transport, can't get up off the floor if he has a fall and doesn't know what medication he has to take.

Ethically, I feel that he should have some say in his future, but I also feel that he's not reasonably considering either her well being, or his well being due to her diminishing ability to adequately care for him without more family support as his condition advances.

We are planning the move regardless of his reticence, but there's going to come a day soon when I have to get him into a car/plane and take him away from his long-term home.  I feel really uncomfortable about lying to him about it (e.g. we are going on a holiday), but equally I feel that reminding him that he won't be coming back will result in him refusing to get in the car (he has been told already but will probably have forgotten by then).

I've tried reasoning with him, arguing with him and insisting he has to do the right thing by his wife, but none of these approaches have worked.

Hopefully some helpful redditors will have some sage advice from their experience with a similar situation.

He's currently in Canberra in Australia

Thanks in advance.",1
"My mum (63) has had diabetes for over 10 years and she isolated herself in the house for two years during lockdown. 

I think these things combined have completely ruined her cognitive ability. She asks the same questions over and over, she won’t remember a conversation you had a few hours ago.

She is able to take care of herself (eating and keeping clean) and she is fully cognitive when you talk to her, she just doesn’t remember things 90% of the time.

How can I plan for the future when she needs full-time care? Is there some kind of insurance (UK)? I’m not sure how much dementia care tends to cost per month.. 

I have been thinking of keeping her house to rent out for payments. Or using her pension? I have no idea how this works, I have no other family :/",1
"My mom is 72, has Parkinson’s dementia and lives with my family of 3 in her own apartment in our basement. She has really mentally declined the past year, and can no longer dress herself. She goes to adult day care daily while I work. It’s hard to care for her, but we have a system that mostly works.

Buuuut she has started something that is driving me nuts and has me seriously considering putting her in memory care. I help her get dressed in the mornings because she can’t do it herself, but then if I leave her alone for a few mins so I can get my kid going, she will take off her clothes. Sometimes in the afternoons or evenings too. Then she comes upstairs in various levels of undress to get me to help her to get dressed again. It’s very frustrating and also embarrassing for my husband and son. I have asked her why she does it (“I don’t know”) and BEGGED her to please just stay dressed, but it doesn’t matter. I honestly think she is lonely and using it as a route for my attention. It’s driving me CRAZY. I did request her neurologist put her on anti anxiety meds to see if that helped a few months ago (lexapro) and it didn’t seem to help.

So I’m considering exploring memory care but also worry she will take her clothes off all the time there, and then what? Will they kick her out? Will she get assaulted by another patient? Scary to imagine. She doesn’t take off her clothes at Day Care, so maybe it’s only a home problem? Does anyone have any advice or experience with this sort of thing?

Thanks for reading.",1
"My mother has fairly advanced vascular dementia and about a year ago was put on Memantine and Donepezil. She was living far away and I was only able to come a few times a year. My brother lived with her but was very inconsistent about her taking her medication (and every other aspect of her care) and I got many reports from her caregiver then about meltdowns, especially when she needed to take a shower. 

I moved her into my home in November and had no inkling she was as far along as she was based on the limited information my brother gave me. Long story short she ran out of donepezil before she came to live with me and we finally were able to renew her prescription when she got in to see the doctor. I read online that initial reactions to the drug could strong and could take weeks to lessen.

She started it again last Friday and it has been a roller coaster. Last night she had her first meltdown about the shower. We've done showers twice a week for the past 2 months and although she sometimes resists she never flat-out refused and always enjoyed them when I got her in there and was grateful afterward. Last night she dug in her heels, sobbing, and completely refused. I probably persisted too long in trying to talk her into it as she was getting more and more upset. Finally, I left her in frustration and just had her go to bed. She cried in her recliner a while longer but eventually went to sleep. 

Maybe it's the meds, maybe it's the progression of the disease, but I just felt so defeated and sad for her and myself. This is harder than I ever imagined, and she's only been here a few months.",1
"Just came back from visiting with the Mother in law who has aphasia.
She caused a ruckus because someone took her napkin at the end of the meal. 
She’s become so grumpy. 
We had high hopes for her in this residence, the people and staff seem so happy and friendly, the setting is lovely and everything she needs is taken care of. 
We take her flowers and treats, new clothes and put her favorite music on, play go fish and sorting games . There’s a little dog and an atrium with budgies. 
It’s so nice. 
But somehow she manages to find a way not to enjoy anything. 

Maybe us visiting every day is not helpful. We invite other resident to sit in the garden with us for a chat so she can enjoy the company. Perhaps she’d be better off if we left her to it and visited less. 
I truly don’t know, this is something we’re learning about as we go. 
In your collective experience, should we only visit a couple of times a week? Less?

"I don't know why I'm posting here, not really. We moved my dad in with us beginning of October. Early onset, diagnosed about 7 years ago. He was walking and getting around and talking pretty well, albeit confused a lot. Then he started having pretty constant hallucinations and became very agitated. Since then, he's deteriorated to the point where now he's sleeping most of the time, not taking much nourishment (he will only take a few bites of any given thing, but he will drink about 2 bottles of premier protein, and losing weight way faster than it seems he should be).... He's not very coherent either, he will walk from his couch, to his bed and that's about it. I'm at a loss. I know this is part of it but I never imagined it happening so fast. Last week we heard back from hospice and they are supposed to contact us this week. Again, I don't know why I'm posting here, what I'm looking for, etc. I want this to be over for him, but I hate seeing him like this. It's so hard to witness this level of decline and I can't help but search for some causation that's not the dementia itself.",1
"I (53 [as of tomorrow] F) noticed serious changes in my mom (75) last year around this time. My parents live in Alaska and my sister and I live in the SW US. After doing some reconnaissance last year, it came out that she’d been exhibiting concerning symptoms for a while. My dad, frustrated during one of our video chats, told me specific concerns, including that mom had more than once 1) left the house to meet friends for lunch and then those friends calling the house looking for her when she didn’t show up and my dad having to go search for her in their small town where she had forgotten her destination in the 10 minutes it took to drive to town 2) spent large sums of money (>10k) but not remembered how she had spent the money, 3) left empty pans in hot burners nearly starting a house fire. 

We gently questioned my mom about this. She was naturally defensive but said she’d go to the doctor. I tried to impress upon her that time mattered. Getting an early diagnosis is important (I worked in healthcare for years. Very familiar with how quickly the disease can sometimes progress after the onset of symptoms).

After two weeks had gone by and she hadn’t made an appointment, I told her I was contacting her doctor. She lost it. She was SO angry. Because she got angry, the rest of the family dropped it. My mom can be a bully in the best of times and makes life miserable for you if you upset her. I felt left out to dry but continued to follow up with her doctor after she stopped allowing my dad to speak with me anymore at all. She felt he had betrayed her by sharing his concerns with me. 

I grew up in Alaska. Worked in healthcare recruiting in that state so I know how difficult it is to get qualified doctors. Because of this, they take whoever they can get. Her GP is no exception. He’s a pediatric internist working there as a general practitioner. 

Her doctor called her to come in after my letter/phone call but he only performed the MMSE on which she scored average. So he told her she was fine and refused to refer her for work up. Had any of the doctors I worked with been in this situation, they’d have set up the referral (at the very least to a geriatric specialist) if for no other reason than to avoid liability. 

Her doctor did nothing. 

Because of this, mom believed she was fine and contacted every family member and told them they were no longer allowed to discuss this issue with her. She went months without speaking to my sister I and wouldn’t let us talk to our dad. 

An entire year has gone by now and I have watched her steadily decline. She had been diagnosed with type II diabetes a year before all of this went down and had reversed it with diet and exercise. She was very strict about it.  But, I can see she’s gained at least 20 pounds over last year and I’m not sure if she’s even managing her diabetes or tracking her numbers. She’s disheveled every time I see her on video chat, no make up, clothes, rumpled. This is a woman who prided herself on her appearance, always dressed very nicely and was well groomed, so this is a huge deviation from the woman I’ve known her to be my whole life. She’s stopped contacting family members, not because I believe she’s angry at us, but because I don’t think she thinks about it anymore. When we do talk to her (if we call her) she’s usually friendly, and will chat with us but will get up and walk away from conversations as if she’s forgotten she’s having them as there occurring. She no longer calls us on holidays or our birthdays, something that she has never missed our entire lives . This is just a small sample of the drastic changes I’ve seen over the past year.

This last weekend, the conversation again turned to my concern about her health after a particularly weird interaction and I couldn’t be quiet anymore. I feel like I’m failing a being a good daughter. I brought up my concern about her health again and she - in no uncertain terms! - told me to fuck off citing that her friends tell her she’s fine and they laugh about the things they forget is they age and that she doesn’t want to talk about this anymore and I’m not allowed. 

I believe she’s bullied my dad into silence. He’s slightly older than she is, and is suffering memory loss more consistent with natural aging, but the rapid rate of decline in her that I’ve seen over the last 12 months is breaking my heart and I just don’t know what to do anymore. 

Flying up there isn’t going to work, which is why I haven’t done it sooner. Attempting to get her doctor on board I felt was my only recourse and that was shut down. I reached out to family members again yesterday, the same ones who left me out to dry last year, and explained again how drastic these changes are with her and that we’re running out of time. I’m not sure if I’ll get their backing. Because of where they live, mom will have to leave the small town they live in when she’s no longer able to live independently which is going to kill my dad. His entire world revolves around her. 

I don’t even know where to start. I feel like I’m losing both of my parents at once and quickly. 

Without her doctors buy in, how do we get her help?",1
"Apologies if this isn’t allowed. But I have to vent. My mom was diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia a year ago and I’m having a hard time with it. She’s always been my strong, smart, can-do-anything mom and I can’t tolerate her LBD behaviors. Her anxiety. Her lethargy. Her paranoia. Her hallucinations. Her stories. Her panicked phone calls. I get angry. I yell, I say mean things, I slam doors, I push her away (not physically), I can’t stand being around her. Every one of her behaviors triggers me and I just can’t control my anger. I’m mad at her for being sick. I’m mad that hiring a live-in caregiver is unaffordable. I’m mad that I have no freedom after her daytime caregiver leaves. I’m mad that I have to deal with a sick parent at such a young age. I try to tap into my empathy, but I have none. I’m just so angry. I’m trying therapy and hope it helps me cope better than I am now. She doesn’t deserve my anger. She’s suffering enough. If anyone has advice or wants to chat, please me know.",1
"My dad has very late stage Lewy body disease. I live in another country. He’s been hospitalized for a few weeks now, and we’re only allowed to visit him 15min per person, per day. So I’m flying halfway across the world to see him for 15 min a day. That’s 3.5 hours I’ll get to see him in the 2 weeks I’ll be there. And it’ll likely be a last goodbye. I’m just so angry all the time. Angry at hospitals stupid policy, angry at well-meaning people who say “I hope he gets better” when I tell them he’s very sick, and angry at my ex/coparent for stupid reasons (thankfully he understands). My grief comes out as anger, which surprises me, and hurts others.. I just feel like a total mess and like I can’t control my emotions and words. Not an excuse. 

I want to set him free. It’s cruel to keep him alive at all costs. My mom said she made chocolate chip cookies for him, his favorite, and the next day he stopped being able to eat and now has a tube in his nose pumping him with “food”. 

It’s nice to be here where people understand the gravity of this disease. Thank you for reading.",1

How does one get a nurse set up to come help out at home? Im lost and I don’t know where to begin at all but we need assistance taking care of him since we both work. He can’t take care of himself and can’t be left alone. A nursing home was an option but we want that to be our last resort. Any help would be incredible. Thank you.",1
"My mum is in secure dementia care but is still pretty articulate, and can manage a good proportion of her own self care.

She can't really explain why she wants them, though, and confessed to me today: ""Now I've got them, they're actually really hard to get rid of."" Bless.

"Hello! My poppy has Lewy body dementia, and after a heart attack and some time spent in the hospital, he went from being barely affected to pretty bad. He has hallucinations, is incontinent, doesn’t sleep, gets violent at night, forgets his house is his house and wants to go to his “real house” and tries to escape, etc.  My nanna has been caring for him at home along with some caregivers she’s hired for different parts of the day/night but it’s becoming too much for her. Her and my mom toured a dementia care senior living facility yesterday and they think the place seems nice and they feel comfortable with him being there. There aren’t many places that’ll take dementia patients especially if they have violent outbursts so this is our best option. My nanna said that when it comes time to move him in next month she’s going to tell him he’s just going to an hotel for a little while, but I’m not sure about that. He’s still very mentally with-it in the mornings and I feel he would definitely understand when he got there that he wasn’t at a hotel and that he was at a facility. His major confusion usually starts after 2 or 3 pm, so when he gets there I just don’t think he’d buy the lie. How should we go about things when it’s time to move him. Tell him he’s going to a care facility or lie and say he’s going to a hotel or something?",1
"I've heard of sundowning and don't think that this is something that my mother experiences (she is either irritable or calm at random times throughout the day and night).  I also have read that people with dementia constantly rearrange things.  My mother rearranges little things (items in drawers and on shelves) all day and night.  However, I've noticed that mornings are different because she's trying to move heavier items like furniture; this almost never happens later in the day.  She's also ""cleaned"" the garage early in the morning, as well.  Is this a known thing that people with dementia feel extra powerful and energetic in the morning?",1
"The doctor only gives my grandma the basic tests like draw a clock or remember these three words.  He has done some other tests, we aren't sure exactly which ones these are, but I believe they hook up leads to her head and measure some kind of electrical signal.

"TLDR - if someone has sensitive skin and/or has recently developed a rash and their clothes being washed with a laundry sanitiser you might need to stop using it!

My dad has been really itchy last month or so and the other week had developed a weird rash. My mum was confused as she hadn’t changed any products she was using and was no obvious cause. 
She does however use a hygiene product so she can wash my dads soiled clothing at lower temperatures. 
I remembered seeing a post on BORU about woman with a mystery rash that turned out to be caused by the active ingredient in laundry sanitiser ‘benzalkonium chloride’. Apparently people can develop a reaction to this stuff after a period of time.

Checked the one mum was using and whilst wasn’t the exact same chemical it was one very similar.
So she stopped using it to see if made a difference and within a week dad has stopped scratching and his rash is starting to disappear.

"My mother is 60 and was diagnosed with alzheimers about 2 years ago. Im 26 and struggling with her rapid decline, and all the feelings of guilt for not being with her all the time. 

I feel so lost and so hopeless and I don’t know what to do. My mum being a single mother, and my absolute best friend - she was always the one person in my life who could do anything and always knew what to say, and how to show me unconditional love. 

I feel like I grieve her everyday and when I’m not with her, I feel the most crippling guilt. She gave me everything and more, and now I feel like I have nothing to give her. When I’m with her, I treat her as I always would, but the reciprocation is difficult for her to express, and as I’m still relatively young, i am struggling without the motherly support i once got. 
I need some support and some help in dealing with this, because I know it’s only going to get harder. 

I can’t process the fact that I’m only 26 and I had so many more milestones and experiences I wanted to have her around for. 

How do I cope with life without the one person that understood me and supported me through my whole life.. how do we put on a brave face and be the best supporters for our loved ones struggling with this disease whilst ensuring our mental health is ok.. it feels like the most overwhelming and daunting thing I’ll ever experience. 

I am well overdue for grieve counselling and regular therapy, however I feel as though nothing can truly prepare me for the steps and feelings ahead through this experience..

"It's not even clear if she has dementia or not but the cognitive decline and inability to function are on par with dementia decline. But because she has always been stubborn and secretive, I'm not sure we will ever actually know before it's too late.

She's been declining in a lot of ways for a while but has seemingly taken it in stride and been quasi open to getting help. A lot of canceled doctors appointments and brush offs over the past few years but to my knowledge, overall in a safe zone.  But last week when I called her she was terribly tired and felt she was to weak to do a lot of things for herself. We talked about getting her an aide and she seemed receptive but was so tired she couldn't continue the conversation. She promised me she had a doctor's appointment in ""a few days"" she she would rest until them. Over the week, it was progressively harder and harder to reach her. It would take 10+ repetitive calls in a row to actually answer the phone and she would say she's sleeping and hang up . No matter what time of day or night, same thing for days. When I finally spoke to her on Sunday, she said she hadn't really eaten or had anything to drink. Moreover, she indicated that she hadn't been taking her medicine for her kidneys and other issues but she promised she would. I was honestly shocked to hear she hadn't been taking her medication as she's been on them for 15+ years and KNOWS that not taking them could lead for her to go into shock (and also cause her muscle weakness, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, lack of hunger...you know, all the things that she's been complaining of for the past 2 years). I didn't know what to think and honestly almost called APS then but I gave her grace and tried to believe her that she would take her medication and figure things out.

Well, 48 hours with no contact from her. It's Tuesday and she should have gone to the doctor by now. She would have told me what he said but she's been radio silent. I called her at different hours today, no answer. I texted her, no answer. When I got home from work I called her. No answer. I called 8 times in a row. No answer. I call one last time and she picks up. She's barely awake enough to say ""I don't feel well I need to sleep"". I told her ""I'm calling an ambulance."" She says"" OK"" and either passes out or falls back asleep because she doesn't hang up. I scream her name multiple times, no answer.

I'm 3k miles away. The only thing I could think to do was call 311 in NYC. They put me through to 911 and they said they would be sending police and an ambulance out. That was 2 hours ago and I've heard nothing since. 

I emailed her POA, who is also her CPA, to let him know. I'm terrified I have done the wrong thing but also terrified that i may be too late. I am completely uncertain of what will happen from here on out and I simply don't know what to do. If she's fine, she will probably hate me the rest of her life. If she's not and this was the right call, then thank hell I listened to my gut. 

I appreciate you listening.",1
"Hello all.  I’m the 47 yo daughter of my father w/dementia.  Currently my mom is his sole caregiver (she’s 75 and not well herself) and I will soon be moving in to assist her.  Dad has taken a turn for the worse the last few weeks.  I last saw him in august of 2022 and the change is shocking.

Our biggest issue is dad is deaf.  I am too,  but I have bilateral cochlear implants and can hear as well as know ASL - sign language.  Dad never learned sign, and has been completely deaf since about 55-60 years old.  He’s 76 now.  He has difficulty reading instructions and with comprehension.  He can do simple tasks but has just lost fine motor skills.  My mom of course is horribly stressed and she gets very angry and frustrated easy which again isn’t good for her health…she has a liver/blood issue that has been recently causing problems.  

they are both on Medicare.  I can get dad to understand better when I type in large font on my iPad, but because he can’t enunciate his words I can’t understand him even though I hear at a near perfect level with my implants.  

My mom has a DNR set up for her but not for Dad yet (this was his wish a few years ago).  I want to respect their wishes and don’t know aside from power of atty what else to do.  Mom needs help in the home.  Dad needs help with everything, toileting, eating.  I’m afraid he’s going to fall because he shuffles everywhere and is not fully aware of his surroundings.  He’s at the point where taking him places is a no-go.

We’re in central Florida and I’m just here for a visit.  My plan was to move in April but looks like it’ll be sooner.  I’m not having luck finding resources or to find out what they’re eligible for.  I’d appreciate any advice.  There’s a chance that dad may outlive mom and I’ll be caretaking at some point.  My kids are grown and I work from home so I’m able to be here.  

Thank you everyone.",1
"Hi all.  After falling and breaking her hip , and the fact her diabetes is very out of control ( type 1 for 45+ years) my mum with vascular dementia isn’t safe at home anymore.   
we have found a lovely nursing home ( uk)  and she will be moved in straight from hospital next week.

any tips for making this transition smooth? I’ve told her at the moment it’s for recovery as she has no aids at home and will need more therapy to get back on her feet . She accepts this , and I’m hoping she will just settle in and forget about going home.   
her short term memory has completely gone. She recognises everyone still and can sort of hold a conversation of sorts. I’m hoping having company will be good for her as she was withdrawing from socialising for a long time now and she is ( used to be) a very sociable person.

 I’m also really struggling with the guilt I’m feeling about her ending up in a home so soon. Her decline has been hastened by a long hospital stay previously due to forgetting her   injections and ending up in a really bad way.   


thanks for any advice… I feel overwhelmed.",1
"My grandma who raised me is currently in the hospital since 3 days, her condition rapidly took a step downhill in the past 6 days, now she has low bp and oxygen level, pneumonia, high blood urea and serum creatinine and swelling in liver and kidneys, she can't eat anything as she's vomiting constantly, her being diabetic is putting great difficulty treating her and her condition is rapidly deteriorating.

I was taking care of her since the 8 months, I am feeling very bad now that i didn't take enough care of her, I sometimes become angry at her because she would cry constantly because my brother goes to another state for the job, I didn't caught the early signs of kidney problem, I downplayed when she said she's feelings cold, I should've bought bigger room heater but I was thinking about high electricity bills.
I am completing my masters along with working online, I studied more than required, I could easily pass but no I want to top this semester, hence couldn't take enough care of her.

It all seems like my faults, I requested my family many times to take her as I am alone here and it's hard to take care of her along with studying and working but they didn't listen
I tried my best, I've lost almost 6 kg weight in these six months due to constant stress and workload.",1
"Sorry for the long post guys, thanks in advance. I will just try to get into it and be to the point. Thinking this might be more schizophrenia, but thought it could also be related to dementia. 

My mother is 58 years old but had previous issues with paranoia in the past. I was a bit too young to remember but she had an episode when we were moving when I was younger, we stayed with family while passing through and she claimed that they were recording her in the bedroom and that she saw a red blinking light (possible high stress situation with moving, don't know all the specifics but this is what my dad told me). She was hospitalized for about a week or two during this time and they prescribed her medication. I don't think she ever continued taking her medication but things did start to get better. I also remember her having another episode claiming my dad was cheating on her and that he had another family due to his long work hours, there were no signs of infidelity or proof, coworkers would all vouch for him and it kind of spiraled out of control.

Recently she has been remembering or has been seeing things that haven't happened and are really troubling. This started a couple weeks ago before Christmas. For context, last Christmas my wife had the idea of renting a cabin for our whole family in summer as a Christmas gift to my parents. Fast forward to about 3 weeks ago, my mom called me out of the blue and told me to make sure that my wife didn't book the same cabin because she saw someone in the basement when doing laundry at the cabin we stayed at last summer (we had the entire cabin). I just thought she was mistaken and her imagination just running a bit wild, but also thought it was entirely weird that if she truly thought she saw something, why didn't she say something about it at the time. I remember she had a great time and was relaxed. I had a long conversation with her and she was not troubled or out of it at all.

When she came over for Christmas, she spent the day with my wife and kids and she ended up telling my wife that she saw the cabin we stayed at last summer on Unsolved Mysteries and a family consisting of a grandfather, grandma, son, daughter-in-law and their two sons (same as our family) were murdered or missing/never found. She was adamant that it was the same cabin and that they closed down all of the cabins in that area due to this. She claimed that two detectives came to her house and began asking her questions about the cabin and the murders. My wife told her that there was no way that anyone would have had her contact information as the cabin was in my wife's name, and that no one tried contacting my wife. She also showed my mom that you could still rent the cabin and that it was available on Airbnb. She has never outright mentioned the murder cabin to me, only to my wife and to her hairdresser.

She also recently began claiming that a few months ago (beginning of Oct) she went to the salon to get her hair cut and they had drugged her by putting something in the glass of water they offered. They took her phone, took pictures of her drivers license, asked her a lot of personal questions about our financial information, social security numbers, full names, addresses, looked at all of our pictures, etc. She actually went and filed a police report this past weekend and is adamant that this happened.

This morning I spoke with the owner of the hair salon and her hairdresser and they both said that they remember her appointment and that everything was completely normal and there were no incidents or nothing out of the ordinary. She described things that I know my mom would have been talking about, said my mom showed her a picture of my grandsons and everything went on normally. She never even held my mom's phone. The hairdresser did say that my mom reached out about a week or two ago and said that she needed the first and last names of all the people who worked at the salon and that two detectives would be stopping by to talk about some murders. She also told her hairdresser that someone tried to run over and kill my wife while she was holding our two sons (which definitely didn't happened).

I live about two and a half hours away from my mom which makes it extremely hard. Her and my dad have been trying to get the house ready to sell so she can move down with us. She spends a lot of time alone and only has a few close friends. There are a few other things that she has been claiming or worried about that are just don't make sense or doesn't seem realistic. When she tries to explain it to me it's all very disorganized and hard to follow.

We had planned on having her come down this week to watch my two sons at our house while my wife and I went out of town for a family wedding in Florida (about 4 days starting Thursday), my dad will help her at the end of the day when he gets home from work and during the weekend. I have a 3 and 4 year old which can be a lot at times with tantrums and emotions. They can stress my wife and I quite a bit at times, so I imagine they could make others feel the same way. Should we concerned, shes so excited about watching them and seems completely fine otherwise? This is my major concern. She has been a loving and great grandmother, and has watched them for a few days at our house before.

What would be the best way to handle this? I don't want to upset her by telling her what she is remembering is not true, especially before watching our kids and turning her world upside down. Is there a particular medical facility that we should look into or get her checked into? Any help on dealing with this the proper way would be a huge help. My dad, wife and I are all currently at a loss on the best way to approach this. We all love her but I just don't know the best way to help her and don't want to compound the issue or create more of a problem.",1
"Is it selfish to put my grandmother in a nursing home because taking care of her is causing the entire family to suffer from mental burnout? My grandma is in the mid stages of dementia, she doesn’t always remember dates, sundowns, showtimes, etc. None of this is really an issue but she tends to make unsafe choices and we can’t have someone home to supervise her all throughout the day, this causes us to worry about what she could potentially get into, whether that be her falling down or her trying to cook something and setting the place on fire! This along with her getting sick quite frequently or just kind of checking out due to depression, is causing a lot of mental exhaustion for her two daughters that in the home and her three grandchildren (i along w my two siblings) although we are all adults it is a lot. We started the process of looking for a nursing home last week when she had another depressive period and was needing 24/7 aid with everything from standing up to going to the bathroom to feeding herself. This week she seems totally fine and on one hand we feel guilty for trying to put her in a home now but on the other hand we know it’s only a matter of time before she gets bad again and we don’t know if we can handle that mentally. So my question is as stated, is it selfish to put her in a home because we are mentally burnt out by the constant care and worry when we’re not around?",1
"One year ago, my dad was diagnosed with AD, and today he is no longer self-sufficient. His live-in partner can no longer provide the care that he needs, so I started researching care options.

Fortunately, he bought a long term care insurance policy about 20 years ago. At the time, he was not aware that his mother would later die with Alzheimer's dementia, after a *very* stressful few months in an expensive care facility. 
Thankfully, his LTC insurance policy becomes active automatically if he is diagnosed with a cognitive brain disorder. The policy has a compound inflation rider, and today pays over $12000 per month for a licensed facility where he can get assistance with ADL.
The impact of this is that I do not have to worry about my father's safety and well-being, I do not need to quit my career or hire caregivers in my home or his.
I have read so many stories on this sub about people whose lives have been upended and nearly destrpoyed form the financial and emotional distress this disease can cause, and I'm so grateful every day that my dad had the foresight to purchase the insurance. It pays lifetime benefits (i.e., until he ""no longer needs care"")

Considering my family history with brain disease (my father's mother and his grandmother both died with AD, and my mother developed and died with what seemed to be LBD), it will be wise for me to purchase some kind of comparable plan, even if it supports only part of my end of life care.

I just thought I would bring this up in case others are also concerned about their own future needs. I know that many don't have room in the budget for this, but it is something to think about if you have AD diagnosis in your family.

"Hoping to get some advice and signs of hope!

My mother (73) was diagnosed with a ""mild"" form of dementia a little over a year ago - though we believe it likely began at least 1-2 years before that. She began with Aricept (still on it) and did speech/cognition therapy for about 5 months.

A bit of forgetfulness, agitation, and difficulty saying words (aphasia) was her biggest symptom. She modestly cooked, cleaned, took care of herself, and could be left alone all day if needed (though she does live with my brother who typically works from home).

December 1st she suffered a (per doctor's remarks) ""mild"" ischemic stroke. She spent six days in the hospital. She has been staying with me at my apartment instead of going back to her house with my brother (this was done because my place is all on 1 level).

The first night in the hospital she could barely speak a full sentence - was nearly nonverbal. This has thankfully improved, but not yet to the degree we were hoping.

When she first came home she needed help with almost everything (getting in and out of bed, being helped to the bathroom, cutting her food, etc). However, she has done GREAT with her physical and occupational therapy. She can now get herself in and out of bed, dress (except for the occasional pesky button now and then), and not only can she use the restroom totally without help she's bathing herself safely. We practice the stairs almost every day and while she's still very nervous, she is moving faster and better almost every time.

My question is - her speech and general cognition have definitely worsened since the stroke. I would say her aphasia prior to the stroke (on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the worst) was on a good day a 4 -- now it's easily a 5 or 6. We are discussing next week with her doctors if returning to speech therapy would help or just bore her / frustrate her as it did last time before the stroke).

I know that it likely will never go back to prior to the stroke - but I am holding out hope that as she continues to make improvements, her speech and cognition will make some modest recovery again as well - even if it just gives us a few more quality years. We are in process of applying to our local area agency on aging + veterans affairs (thanks to my late father's military service) for financial and at-home help to help make her eventual return home as stress-free as possible.

Did ANYONE out there go through something like this and can give me some hope? 

Any advice you would offer? 

Doctors and all online research I can find the state that post-stroke recovery can continue in big leaps for up to 6 months -- I keep telling myself she's doing better each week and it's only been 1 month.

While I want honesty, for this post at least, PLEASE know I am looking for some valid reasons to hope she will get a bit better, even if it's not back to her pre-stroke level. Please (with love) take negativity for sake of negativity elsewhere.

For all the caregivers out there -- I send my love and thanks.",1
"FIL has progressing dementia, lives alone about 8 mins from us, and we need to move him to a home soon bc it’s becoming too much for us to keep up with him and his house. The memory care facilities we are looking at are at LEAST $5k/month. Living with us is not an option (we only have 3 bedrooms and we have a toddler and a 4 month old). No other family on my husbands side is still alive except my FILs sister but she has cancer so she can’t live with anyone else (or so she says). How the f*** do people afford this? I don’t see him passing away any time soon so the fear of running out of money is very real. 

Am I missing something?

Edit for clarity: we are in Arizona. There is no surviving spouse. He owns his house but it is nowhere close to being paid off. He is in the middle stage of dementia. He can still (somewhat) use a cell phone and can still manage most day to day tasks (feeding his dogs, showering, etc) and we help him with all appointments, med regulation, groceries, etc. He doesn’t drive.",1
"We found out the diagnosis a couple years ago right after my daughter was born. She’s now almost 3 and absolutely adores her “poohpooh” we just had another baby and he’s very different with the new baby than he is with her. He has started to notice he’s getting worse. Has anyone ever been through this with a grandparent?? Is the difference bc he knows he’s not gonna get to have a relationship with my son?? Is it bc he has a hard time recognizing him sometimes?? I’m not mad at him for it at all and it’s definitely not favoritism bc he was so excited when he found out we were having his little hunting buddy but now that things are getting harder it’s almost like he doesn’t wanna hurt himself or my son. Idk?? 
Any thoughts/advice?? How do you navigate not crying all the time bc that’s all I’m doing. My dad died when I was 2 and he’s been the best bonus dad and I’m so sad that I’m not gonna have all the time with him I thought we would and I hate it for my mom even more. 😭",1
"My stepmom (76) has been declining for years. Recently, she has become unmanageable. She has delusions, paranoia, hallucinations, and is combative and extremely agitated. 

We recently had to do a five day emergency respite because she was so manic we couldn’t manage her at home.  She didn’t sleep for two days and talked/argued/prayed/whimpered nonstop during that time. 

Now, we have to determine permanent placement. The facility where she was for five days says they can’t keep her because she scored too high on the cognitive scale to reside in their secured unit, and she can’t live in the regular unit because she is a flight risk. 

She tends to do the “showtime” thing where she pulls herself together long enough for the cognitive test, then regresses. 

She cannot come home. My dad can no longer manage her care. 

Are there long term care options for someone like her?",1
"LONG POST

So my grandma has never been a good person. She was so controlling and manipulative. Whenever she would go to Pakistan with my mum or her other daughter in law, she would refused to let them visit their parents. 

She would take my dads hard earned money from him and told him to ask for her permission if he wanted to use that money for anything. She was a very abusive and toxic person.

She hated my cousin, who is her maternal granddaughter, because of her dark complexion. And she also didn’t like my brother and I honestly don’t know why but she would bully them both.

She would humiliate her kids in front of other people just because she like to be in control. She never treated anyone with respect. All of her kids are mentally messed up and have also become abusive in many ways. However she did spoil her daughter a lot. Her daughter, my Aunty followed her in footsteps in becoming a terrible person herself. 

My grandma is now 80 years old and has dementia. Well the doctor said she’s on the verge of Alzheimer’s. Although she has mobility, she still has to be observed 24/7.

my grandma has 3 children, my dad, my uncle, and my Aunty. 

My grandma lives with my uncle and his wife. They’re terrible people and the only reason they ‘take care’ of her is because they are living off of her money.
They took over her money as soon as her dementia started progressing

My family and I live in a 3 bedroom house and we don’t have an extra room for my grandma. No one works in my family except me so we can’t even provide for her financially.

My Aunty’s situation is similar. 

My uncle and his wife have changed their home interior many times since they’ve been using her money.

"My parent in laws’ memory has apparently never been great according to my husband, but lately there have been several red flags

Would appreciate people’s insights as I have personal issues against them, and sometimes I don’t know if I’m being overly critical or if this is something that needs attention and diagnosis 

Mother in Law (more serious) 
- Setting up security questions for a new account - she could not remember her own mothers first name nor any school she grew up going to 
- Thinks that radiation from certain electronic devices give her headaches (ie. Newer phones and iPads, but NOT things like airplanes, cars, TVs, etc) 
- Uncharacteristically unaware of important things, like reaching in the toaster oven to grab a hot pan bare handed when the toaster oven is clearly on and hot…at important events like weddings, completely unaware she is holding up people who are involved and making things significantly late 
- General confusion. The examples are about tech stuff which was never their forte, but the issues seem more serious. ie. She deleted a text without reading it and then asked us all what it said. She wrote a letter she wanted to mail and wrote “hope this email finds you well” - when asked why she wrote “email” when she didn’t intend to email it, she didn’t really have an answer 

Father in Law
- Cannot remember any new names (same with MIL)
- Cannot remember birthdays or holidays like Mother’s Day (same with MIL)
- They usually host and make the main course for family dinners. It was his daughters birthday and he completely forgot to buy/prepare any food. His daughter showed up and didn’t smell any food and it was only when she asked when he realized he forgot  
- Cannot recall events that we attended together. ie. We all went to a wedding and I (his daughter in law) was in the wedding party. 2 months later he told us about the wedding as if we weren’t there (“did you know in the summer we went to ____’s daughters wedding? Her name is uh…I can’t remember…but anyways it was at ____” 
- Forgot (or confused about) how to put on a belt when getting dressed",1
"I am 29M in Perth, Australia. my grandma (mothers mother) has had dementia for going on 7 years now. the last few years in particular she has declined dramatically - stopped speaking english (reverted back to German and then to just Gibberish), harder and harder to communicate with and now she is bed bound, doesnt eat much and does not even respond to human interaction at all, her care place keeps her slightly sedated.

I visited her on NYE and i just felt so fucking hopeless seeing her in this condition and also seeing my mum cry

I would love to hear from people about how their experiences with a grandparents dementia and how I could possibly at all support my Mum through what ill call the worst of it.",1
"I always hear that any change in routine upsets dementia patients, keep to a routine, etc.  But my grandma is very much an extrovert... she's also only about a 4-5 on the Alzheimer's scale right now, and she loves to go out and talk to people, and to do things, go on vacation, etc.  She also seems a lot better when she's in a large crowd of people, she has new things to think about all the time and so she doesn't get stuck in the same thought routine and recycle conversations so often.  Sometimes she'll say something that makes it clear she has absolutely no idea what's going on, but for the most part she's a lot happier on vacation to let everyone else take care of things, whereas when she's at her own house she'll get anxiety about so many things she should be taking care of but can't, and get really agitated when she sees me taking care of them (cooking, cleaning, mail sorting, fixing the channels on the tv for her, etc.).  

Ironically, I am very much an introvert and would be happy staying in all day with the same routine!  But we go out and go around and talk to everyone to make grandma happy.  

Anyone else have an experience like this?",1
"My 90 year old grandmother was diagnosed with vascular dementia at 82 she is now 90 years old. she has had her fair share of hospital visits throughout those years with UTI’s, bowel infections and falls. she overcame all of that. In the last two months particularly two weeks she has gone excessively down hill. She was dehydrated and needed to be taken out of her nursing home to hospital to be given a drip. She is on the drip on and off for 8 days now and she refuses to eat. She will eat one day very lightly and not the next at all as-well as excessive daytime sleepiness. She used to eat sitting up with a little assistance but only on the last two weeks with the hospital and dehydration episode is she bed ridden. My mother is becoming exceedingly frustrated with her because she won’t eat and they are fearing that she is dying although doctors and nurses wont tell us what is going on with her…they say her oxygen is good aswell as her blood pressure and all her vital signs. Can someone tell me what might be going on and has anyone experienced what this could be leading to?

Update: I just wanted to give you guys an update that my grandmother aged 90 passed away on the 10th January. Given everything this was indeed her transition stage. I definitely knew that when looking at her she was passing. She even had a moment about two weeks before asking about my grandfather who already passed. It brings me comfort in that perhaps she knew she was going to go and she could have possibly seen something for her to say that. She is in a better place now and she had a beautiful life granted her 10 year battle with dementia",1
"My grandma is 75. I was adopted by another (great family ) because my birth mom died and the state ruled her unfit as placement for me due to “probably borderline schizophrenia and reclusive behaviors “. The judge even barred her from visiting me supervised when I was 4 due to her “troubling behavior “. She is unfortunately still unstable. I rented a house to her and she agreed to pay rent, moved in and would not pay, yet complained about the house, so I sold it. She demanded to come stay with my kids and I and demanded my husband leave because “she hates men & they serve no purpose”, he of course didn’t leave (I eventually made her leave ). She was told to sleep in the guest room, but immediately took my sons bedroom/ bed after being told not to. She laid in bed all day and when she was not in bed, she paced Around with her purse under her arm. She constantly lost her keys/purse. I asked her to not block me in the driveway, as I had to go places and she would just say “uh oh “ when I told her the rules or asked her not to do certain things. I could not clean the house because she followed me around and started talking or asking questions. There wasn’t a time she was not barging into our rooms/ bathrooms, or talking. The kids became annoyed because they could be sleeping or playing video games and she barged in wanting to say really odd things “the cat needs a bubble bath “ or that the cat was sad and lonely. She told me she would chip in for her own groceries/ part of the bill and then kept saying I needed to buy her groceries for the week, drank all of our soda, ate nonstop (despite being obsessed with high sodium or sugar levels). She also began making homophobic and racist remarks about people on tv, the day I refused to buy her an expensive dinner she wanted she said “I’ll just leave then since you aren’t supporting me like you should be “. She lives in a motel and I had to beg her to bathe while she was here, she went a month before without a proper bath (she just used wipes ) and only bathed once the week she was here because I put my foot down. Does this sound like dementia ? Are lack of boundaries common? Like she saw us with headphones on or on the phone and began talking and responding to what I was telling the caller thinking I was talking to her. When I told her she needs to go to a senior apartment where she can be with likeminded people and staff she became irate and texted me threats and profanity and I had to block her. I haven’t dealt with this before but do know her mother and grandma died in their 80s from Alzheimer’s",1

What else do I need? How will I get her into and out of bed, or from the chair to the toilet? She's still walking short distances but it's a matter of time it feels like before she isn't.

"My sister never had or wanted to have a warm relationship with me, and she is also my mom's preferred daughter.  After dad passed away and she put my mom in dementia care, she stopped all communications with me, except very functional ones like what stuff to send to mom in care packages. It's been almost a year since this, and we might meet each other as we might visit mom at the same time !! I'm not looking forward to it and almost thinking of cancelling my tickets. The only problem is until mom is alive. I don't want her to feel sad knowing that we have been estranged since dad died.  If we meet face to face, how should I behave as an elder sister since she doesn't respect me and she was the one to have unnecessarily picked a fight and blindsided me. After decades of chasing her to try and have a decent relationship, I could not go on like that and have since kept to myself. I accepted that if we were to have any relationship, she also must want it as much. She never loved me. Her problem with me is she always expects me to run and stay at home with my mother to solve any problems as she is based abroad while I'm in another city in the same country, which is impossible as I have a child while she chooses to remain childless. While I always rush in case of mom's frequent hospitalisation, I could never stay at home for long intervals to help fix maintenance issues due to the pandemic and my own job etc.  


How should I behave with her if we meet at the care centre? I just don't have the energy to handle blames and fights anymore. Thanks for your suggestions in advance.",1
"My mother had an episode over the summer and was committed to a psychiatric ward where they gave her a mood stabilizer.

My father moved her to Florida where hes going to winter and then he's going to leave her there for the summer. He had to go back to the house and when he came back she looked extremely frail and is very out of it. To be honest I don't think she's going to last till the summer. I wonder why she's getting so skinny, if it could be the medicine or maybe they're not feeding her enough or maybe she's not eating and they're not making her. She's used to decent food and going out a lot.  so I can imagine the cafeteria food at the nursing home probably isn't interesting for her. Not sure what the point of my post is other than is there a way to fix this or is it her just saying she's had enough and is slowly shutting down?",1
"I posted in here the other day, asking for general info and now that my grandma is on day 3 of living with me, I have some specific questions and concerns that I'm hoping someone has some advice on.

 We are still working to get a diagnosis for my grandmother (85) but her PCP and I are operating under the assumption that she has Dementia. For a month or so, she was in her home. My uncle lives there, but is an alcoholic that depended on her for his own care. So for a month, I was there 7x a week, sometimes twice a day to do her daily living. He provided no assistance to her, so we were forced to care for them both. 

The nursing home she was in after a brief hospitalization discharged her, as she did not meet level of care. (Personally, I think that she should meet the level of care, and that a residential home isn't gonna give enough support. But here we are.) She has declined in her mobility VERY quickly and needs a lot more assistance than she ever needed living at home.  

She's sleeping a lot right now, but thats another struggle for another day. Some things are going well, but we are struggling with toileting. She has quickly figured out how to get to the toilet and is able to get there and back from her new bedroom with no assistance ( aside from a spill she took yesterday because she was trying to hurry)  The issue is that she does have accidents in her depends and cannot change them or wipe herself after she goes #2. 

We purchased her a call light, with the intention that she could call me when she needed my assistance, but she will not use it. She has expressed understanding in the call-light, and can point it out on her walker when asked. But she just does not use it. So for the past three nights, I've been relying on a motion activated camera in my dining room to let me know when she's up and on the move. Each time my phone goes off, I have to disconnect from my CPAP, come downstairs (steep, old stairs), and get to the bathroom. She had no accidents last night, but since I can't trust her to call for help if she does, I feel like I have to come downstairs each time to make sure she doesn't need changed and provide any additional help. This happens up to 5-6x a night, sometimes more if she isn't sleeping well as she always feels like she needs to pee. She also has scheduled meds to take, so between the restroom trips and her 9PM and 9AM meds, I'm getting so little sleep. She is typically up at 11PM, 1AM, 3 AM, 6AM, then sometimes at 7-8 AM. During the day, it's a little easier since I'm normally up and doing things around the house. 

We are very new to this, and didn't get much support from the nursing home as far as what equipment she'd need and all that. So we just ordered a bedside commode, and I hope this makes it safer to use the restroom at night. But it doesn't eliminate the problem of her needing help wiping after #2, and I don't know how to handle this. 

I work from home full-time, and while my husband is supportive, he doesn't do any of the hands-on care like toileting because we don't think grandma would be comfortable with it. So it's 100% on me, 24/7. Her insurance covers no help at home, and community resources are limited here, and despite her assessment they weren't able to help either. 

Any advice on how to handle this or just support would be appreciated. Thanks in advance, this group has been so helpful!",1
"I know most of us seem to have small humorous stories that help break up the parts of dementia that drag us down. 

I wanted to share what my Grandma did. She got some new warm nightgowns, a few puzzles, and new sunglasses for Christmas. Well today she decided she didn't need to get dressed because I guess she preferred her new night gown. She sat at her little table in her room and was inspecting her gifts. I came back by her room to find she had put on her sunglasses. She then wore them out to the living room. I'm glad she likes them.",1
"My grandmother (88) has dementia and is currently in memory care, but we've decided to have her move in with me (I've been providing additional care 5 days/wk for a year).

I'm compiling a list of things purchase to prep my house. Shower chair, child locks for cabinets, ect. Here are my questions:

What items/supplies do you recommend? What made life easier for you and/or for your LO? Anything! Even if it's fun stuff!

What activities keep your LO stimulated, entertained, active (she uses a walker)? Outings? 

Thanks so much!!",1
"For about 3 years now my grandma has been sick multiple times with UTIs that turn into C-Diff from the medication, she’s been through that atleast 4-5 times in the past few years and each time it last for the span of a month or so. My grandpa used to be her main caregiver even when she didn’t require care, he very much coddled her. He passed just over a year ago after a short battle with pancreatic cancer. My grandma has significantly deteriorated in the past year since grandpa died. Grandpas death was about as peaceful as you can get, he slipped into a coma about three days prior and he died at home surrounded by family, he just stopped breathing and that was it. It has been traumatic for our family but everyone else was able to live with the loss and carry on. Grandma however got sick even more often and started to really forget things and be confused quite often, also sundowning began. We live in a home of 7 people ranging in age of 3-85 two of her daughters live here, 3 grandchildren and one great grandchild all in one house. We have been working our asses off trying to help her but she just doesn’t want to help herself. She gets in these funks where she all of the sudden can’t walk and is falling all the time and needs help going to the bathroom, getting dressed, even just getting into bed. All night Christmas night my mom and I were up with her from 11pm to 8am the next day bc she needed help about every 15 minutes. But then my cousins, her youngest daughters family, came in town yesterday and suddenly she’s perfectly fine, when she hasn’t been able to care for herself in the least since Christmas. She is unknowingly kind of manipulating us into just doing everything for her and we can’t do it anymore. We all work full time jobs and help my sister look after her son who’s 3 and lives in the home, not to mention the absolute mental burnout it’s causing everyone. We’re looking at nursing home in the area and are likely going to move her, everyone is just kind of terrified to put her in one because she has a history of suicide attempts and we wouldn’t be surprised if she just kills herself or just wastes away and dies. I’m scared and don’t know how I’m going to deal with losing my grandma especially after losing my grandpa so suddenly last year. Anyways if you read this whole thing, props to you and I’d appreciate any advice anyone is willing to give!",1
"Well, my grandfathers hard fought battle is over. I feel weirdly relieved. I think I did most of my mourning and grieving when he was still alive but not himself and he went downhill extremely fast. I just kept praying and praying that he wasn’t suffering, and I just hated it. So much waiting around-as morbid as it seems- as your loved one sits there as a vegetable, a former shell of what they once were. Unable to speak, to even possibly see you or recognize you. 
I’m just glad he’s at peace and his soul and mind are no longer stuck in a body that can’t do anything. 
Please let me know if any tips for helping my grandmother during this time.",1
"What have peoples experiences been with doll therapy and those robo-cats ? My mom is 83, in late-middle stages. She lives in a small memory care facility, is on antidepressants and resists getting up in the morning with all her might. 

I hear these items suggested often, but then do not have a sense of outcomes, or rates of success. Do you have stories to share?

ps, i am an only child with no kids of my own and I worry that a doll might result in nagging from my mom.",1
"I’m wondering if anyone is aware of what resources there are in the UK for dementia sufferers and their families? 

My father in-law has dementia and has deteriorated quite quickly this year. He’s had memory issues for a while, but it now seems he has no short term memory - we visited him at Xmas but he now has no recollection of this.

We don’t currently have a diagnosis and this is proving tricky as we live 3 hours alway. My wife has been trying to get in touch with his GP, but they said he would need to go in to discuss the issues he’s having, which is an issue as he has a hard time remembering beyond a few minutes and is either unaware or in denial that he has any issues. It’s looking like the only option is to take him ourselves.

I was wondering if there are any resources available to help or offer advice as we’re not really sure what to do for the best. He lives on his own in “sheltered housing” but they aren’t much help at all. I think he needs someone, eg a social worker to check on him. No idea how he’d go about getting one though.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",1
"I've spent small fortunes buying my mother ( who doesn't always remember who I am), clothing and jewelry etc.. that she tells me she wants.  When I get there, she doesn't like any items I brought even though she picked them out on my phone from Amazon.

I've also made homemade dinners she's begged for, which I call her 10 minutes ahead to let her know I'm bringing dinner.  She always ends up rejecting the food I've worked hard preparing and keeping hot.

I know she's not doing this intentionally,  but it took me a long time not to take it personally.  I just want to find a way to give her my love, yet it's just no longer possible for her to comprehend, or show  love in return.

It's been a heartbreaking lesson.  I spent months in pain and grief.  Now I finally learned the nature of this terrible disease is different for each person, and we-their loved ones, can only live with the knowledge we tried our best to hang onto their love they no longer feel or remember.

It's a tough lesson, but I'm learning.",1
"Apologies if this isn't the right place for this but I need to get this out in place that would understand.

My grandma (80s) has Alzheimer's and seeing it play out in real time is eating me up on the inside. I care for my grandma during most of the week and (on weekends I work at a SNF) and every day I have to care for her is a fight about something. 

Get out of bed? No she doesn't want to  

Take her meds that prevent seizures? Nope she hates her  ""damn pills"" 

Have her eat? She just wants coffee and isn't hungry

Put her dirty clothes in the hamper? No she wants to wear them again (for the third day in a row)  

Anytime I try and get her to do these things she cries about how unhappy she is and how much she wishes that God would come and get her already. She cries she's not useful to anyone and that she just wants to be the person she used to be and on and on (it could go on for an hour or more if I let her). 

Every. Single. Day 

Trying to get her to do *anything* even things she can still do independently turns into a meltdown that I ""don't understand"" and more crying quite often. I have intractable chronic migraine so this constant arguing and crying triggers my migraines which makes *me* upset. It makes me feel terrible that I get so agitated with her because I know she can't help it. She's upset she can't do things anymore which is perfectly reasonable for someone who was once so independent. I'm reaching my limit with how much of the same argument I can tolerate. I wish I could just run away from it for even a week. 

I would love to send her to some of the day programs that aging services has but she gets scared if we're not with her when she's out. Even when we do go out she can't be out for more than an hour before she demands to go home and check on our cat.

The doctor won't put her on any more meds to help with her depression saying that it'll make things worse. 

I hate having to convince her she needs to live when her quality of life is deteriorating. She doesn't want to be alive and I don't want her living like this, but there's nothing we can do since it's a terminal disease. It's like my dad and I cemented in place watching the person who we love so much vanish and be replaced by someone scared and confused. We're all miserable and I wish she could get what she wants and just peacefully pass in her sleep so she won't have to live this life.


TL; DR My grandma is tired of living and wants to die and I wish it would just happen so she's not suffering anymore.",1
"My mom has a very strong affection to sweets, which I understand is typical with Alzheimer’s patients. But, what about the carbs? She’ll be given chicken and mashed potatoes, only eats the potatoes (the only veggie she’ll eat.) Now its mashed potatoes and a bag of chips. Anyone else have a lo with carb addiction? At this point, I give her what she wants. I’m curious about the carbs though.",1
"My grandmother is in a private long-term care home in Canada. I see very little in planning for their patient population who not only have dementia but are often frail, confused, at risk of falling, and who often don't see or hear well.

Things I've noticed include:

1. The newly-renovated (!) dining hall and hallways are not carpeted. This makes the floors slippery and very noisy. The first is dangerous; the latter can be highly stressful.
2. Instead of walk-in showers in their private bathrooms, each bathroom has a tub with shower. The step-over isn't high for an able person; but is a real fall risk for most of the residents. My grandmother has not had a shower in 8 months.
3. The mugs for coffee and tea are too heavy for many of the residents to hold safely. The smaller cups have delicate handles that are difficult for arthritic hands to hold.
4. The bedroom doors are far too heavy to be safely opened or closed -- or navigated through -- by many people, especially those in wheelchairs and walkers.
5. Theft is an issue in most homes. A locked door is of no value when residents lose their keys or forget how to use them. Can we replace regular locks with keyless ones? (They use fingerprint or palm recognition, and sell for around $50).

These are just a few of my pet peeves. What have you seen?",1
"Hello everyone. Thank you all for your posts and this forum...what a resource and blessing!

I have loads of issues and questions but figured I'd start small. I'm dealing with my second family member with dementia. I about fell over when he was squeezing his thumb and forefinger together tightly, then handing me invisible...something? He balls up his fist tightly too, then wants me to take it. But there's never anything there. It shocked me because my late grandmother did the exact same thing all the time with alzheimers. I thought it was just her thing, but now I wonder if it's common.

Have you experienced this and know why they do it?",1

"His behavior became significantly worse throughout the last couple of years. Family believed he was just getting meaner since that was the most prominent symptom, as well as a decline in personal hygiene. Finally, he was diagnosed with dementia. Family however belive to a large degree, he is either being manipulative or using it to lash out and be verbally abusive. He will be in the middle of an argument or outburst, and someone new will enter the room, and it will seem to just turn off. So they have a tendency to believe he is using it as an excuse. There have also been accusations of him hitting my grandmother (unfortunately, we cannot take her word for it as she has a history of exaggerating or fabricating some instances) she also has signs of dementia He has denied it numerous times up until today, claiming yes, I hit her, and it's no one's business. This was at a time of extreme stress and anger. I have a feeling he said this out of either frustration or anger at the accusation or possibly delusion. We have seen him get a little agressive ie. Smacking her arm to get her attention or pushing her along to move faster, but not outright hitting, He has become excessively controlling and lashes out irrationally. All obvious signs of dementia, but they are adamant that he is faking it a lot or using it to get his way. I am in desperate need of help trying to get them to understand and look at the future as a patient/caregiver relationship. Whether it is him being manipulative or not to treat it as another reaction to his disease.  They become too emotionally reactive, and it becomes counterproductive. Has anyone had these same feelings or experiences of questioning the validity of the patients actions? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: Thank you, guys, for putting my mind at ease. I had conversations with a few family members, including my mother, about how they are approaching the situation. I had to have a come to Jesus moment with some. They were all Gung-ho to go in guns blazing and confront him on his behavior, and demand he change his attitude. With help from other family members, we were able to convince them they have been approaching the situation in the worst way for everyone.  It shouldn't have come to this, but I'm glad we were able to get some family members to look at the situation in a more objective way. As patient and caregiver rather than angry parent and resentful kids. Good luck to everyone and thanks again.",1
"Some of my grandfather s behavior is highly annoying to say the least. Over the holidays I spent extended time with him, and I'm now concerned that he may be mentally declining but he refuses to get checked out by a doctor. He doesn't believe in doctors, ""cause they're all quacks"". 

Some of his behavior includes the following:

He is concerned that his phone calls are being tapped by secret police, and is highly paranoid of people/ things. 

He completely forgets to pay bills/ pays the wrong amounts due.

He's to busy to eat most days/ isn't hungry, even though he's retired/ and doesn't have any real work to do. 

Asking him simple questions like, ""I'm going to McDonald's to get a cheeseburger, would you like one?"" He struggles to answer, and isn't sure.

He was a professional maintenance worker/ carpenter for many years, yet his house is falling apart and in need of maintenance. When I offer to fix things, he doesn't want my help, or has to micromanage as he's very particular about everything, and is unhappy with any work that is done by anyone other than himself. 

I don't know what I can do/ should do. Any ideas/ suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Edit: Thank you all for the helpful suggestions! I really appreciate it!",1
"
I am responsible for my Grandmother with dementia.  She is currently in a retirement home and believes she has won a great deal of money and wants to know her balance in this account she has somewhere.

I know she doesn’t have the money as I am in charge of her finances.  She still has access to her credit card which she is using too much.  As her POA I am working on setting limits on her credit card, so that’s in progress.

Some advice I would like is how to tell her that there is no money or account.  Everything I have read says to not argue or tell her that things aren’t real as to her it is very real and will just upset her, but I need to get her aware that she doesn’t have this money. She is wanting to move to a nicer home, but expensive things, etc, so this is becoming a problem.


Any help or advice would be amazing.

Thank you so much in advance!",1
"My grandma has dementia. She's in her 80s, lives alone, recently diagnosed. My dad amd his siblings have no idea what they're doing and it pissing me off. My dad tries to get her to remember things that she doesn't and confronts her delusions/fantasies. His siblings argue with her and help her as best they can. But my grandma is stubborn and a control freak. It's really pissing me off.

"Ok so for those of you who don’t know, semantic dementia is a rare form of dementia that begins by taking the victim’s ability to understand language and to communicate. Because it’s so rare I’ve been unable to find many resources on it. Any resources would be appreciated on anything to do with it. 
Now onto what the situation is right now:
He’s in his mid 70s, and can only speak a few words. He mostly communicates through pointing. It’s hard to tell how much he understands when we speak but he can’t understand much from what I’ve seen (seems hard to communicate things to him like “lunchtime”) 
He has clearly got a lot of reasoning ability left though I can’t tell how much he remembers. He gets excited and points at photos of places he has been to when he sees them in a travel magazine and whilst he is slower than the rest of the family at games like rummikub (a number game) and genius square (a puzzle about fitting blocks into patterns) he can still complete the puzzles fairly well but he can’t remember how to use a camera (formerly his second biggest hobby after bird watching) or similar things. I think he remembers that I’m at least someone he knows well but I’m not sure he remembers we are related. 

Is there any way anyone here knows of to communicate with him? Even basic communication like a rudimentary form of sign language, anything that you know of that could work",1
"My and my girlfriend moved in with my grandma in May after she was diagnosed with dementia and her mobility has declined quite significantly.

One thing we’re struggling with majorly is my grandma just will not do anything to stimulate her mind. She’ll stare into space or out of the window all day with the radio on.

She used to like to do puzzle books, and we’ve tried to ease her into doing them again but won’t entertain them. She doodles on a calendar each day (where we’d usually put a cross day by day, she’ll put like a squiggle or doodle) so my mum bought her some colouring books and blank books. She won’t entertain those either. I know people have suggested before it’ll be a matter of she simply ‘can’t’ anymore. But living with her it’s more stubbornness, she’s written Christmas cards and done all sorts.

Though this aside, she’s still relatively independent and will try and do things around the house, she openly admits it keeps her going and gives her something to do. I’m glad she does still move and try and keep going instead of just rotting in a chair, but we keep trying to tell her that her body just isn’t up to many of the household chores anymore. 

But instead when we do chores and won’t let her, she sits and sulks. But this is why we moved in to begin with, to help her around the house.

I’ve found she’s enjoying things we put on the TV, but there’s not always anything on, or we’re not always home to do it for her, and she won’t let us show her how to use it either.

We’re just stuck. Instead she sits staring into space and overthinking and it’s becoming so stressful we’re really struggling",1

"My demented mother-in-law hadn't showered in 2 weeks (it's been so cold, she punched and scratched us the last two times we did get her in the shower, yada, yada, yada) but this morning we realized she was rank. I had hoped the caregiver would do it this afternoon, but nah.

I got home from work and told her I was sorry that I  hadn't gotten her shower ready yet but I  would do it right after dinner. I told her I appreciated her patience. During dinner I  said I  would get it ready as soon as we were done. 

I turned on the space heater in the bathroom, got her pajamas ready, laid out towels, started the water, then told her I was sorry to keep her waiting but it was all set. We got her out of her clothes and into a bathrobe, led her into the bathroom, and got her into the shower.

There were a few hiccups. She said the water was too hot, she was too cold, her hair was already clean (yuck) the water hurt her, etc., but she didn't punch me. I got her to take the hand held shower head so she could control the water. I loaded up a scrubby with body wash and started on her back. She washed herself all over, she let me wash her hair.  She got into soft pajamas, I put lotion on her ankles and feet, put on her fluffy socks. She was happy and glowing.

Why is it so damn much work to get a formerly fastidious adult to bathe? Are there any demented loved ones who want to wash?",1
"I understand that the person afflicted with dementia, regardless of the type, doesn't  believe they're ill.  The ability to to be oriented to place and time and reality is damaged.  

She keeps referring to her 90 y.o. sister whom she still believes is in long term care back in Maryland and wants us to move to independent living at the same place.  The reality is that her sister, with late stage dementia, is in memory care, unable to function and has 24 hour nursing care.  Though I know better than to explain that to my wife, I still do, because I become frustrated as she goes on and on about her plans for us to move back and how many good years we have in front of us.  The more likely scenario, given her ongoing rapid decline, is that she'll be in memory care by the end of 2023.  

My stress level is gradually escalating, notably with hypertension, which I didn't have.  I'm more concerned about my mental and physical health.  And, as I always say, she's going to get worse.

"I live at home with my mother.  She's in her early 70s. Over the past year I started to tie together some behaviours that I was observing and I think maybe dementia is brewing with her.  She still has a lot of capacity and functions and independence but there is some stuff that's not quite right.

Some of the behaviours I observed:
- going on and out of periods of no conversation. I am mindful of my own behaviours and attitude and we don't generally fight and I don't crititise and I am not sarcastic and I am somewhat positive.
- finding some of my clothing and underwear amongst her clothes.  She doesn't do my laundry and we keep out laundry separate.  A lot of my underwear is ending up amongst hers. It does look like she's stealing my underwear. Even though we are different sizes. She is slim and I am plus size. Our underwear don't even look the same.

These are the biggest things I noticed.  I observed other behaviours
- she eavesdrops and snoops
- there is some ocd stuff

Her demeanour - she gets mad easily.

I started to tie up so much together and I think she has dementia starting.

I work as a nanny.  The parents call upon me so much.  I often go above and beyond for them.

I am just after getting another message from them where they want me to do a weekend for them and stay overnights for the weekends.

I'm thinking all these overnights are just not suitable for me any more. I want to make more effort at home and be at home more often in case my mother is acting out, for attention.   Basically I want to keep her company more instead of leaving her alone so often. I know she doesn't need 24 care as of yet but I would like to keep her company. 

What do you guys think? Is it a good idea to step back from the family I work for to be more free to keep my mother company.  I don't have any other siblings to help me.  She doesn't have a partner.",1

I feel so bad for her, it wasn't supposed to be like this. My greatest fear in life has been losing my mother and now it's becoming reality.

"Basically the title. 

My mom only has opinions about certain things, none of them relevant to her care anymore. If I asks her if she wants to do something she says I don't care, if I ask her if she wants to come to the grocery store, or what she needs from the grocery store, she says I don't care. I want to do my best to keep her involved so she doesn't feel useless (she tells me that all the time even when I engage her) but it's beginning to make me anxious to a point that I'm just gonna ""run the house my way"" and have her along for the ride. But that seems unkind since she lives here too. 

But holy hell trying to get anything done and waiting for her approval is exhausting...maybe it's because I'm her son and 33yo. I do all the finances and stuff behind the scenes to avoid any arguments or panic (she thinks she is making a salary that pays the bills ""working from her phone"" but really it's her texting random relatives things about some business that doesn't exist), but goddamn even deciding on what to have for dinner is becoming a chore. 

Half the time I just eat what I want and make sure there's healthy enough food around that she will pick through. I just miss cooking with my mom without all the other nonsense. Interacting with her has become so simplified that I feel like I'm being demeaning or something because I'm just like ""oh yeah? That's cute...what color was the doggy on the tv?""",1
"hi all, I’ve been lurking for a minute and the relief and advice has been like a balm to my wounds. I’ve felt foolish, guilty and at times angry with the world and myself.

I’m dealing with a husband (70)who has vascular dementia and I suspect it’s been for years, this year his physician asked had we ever heard of vascular dementia! So off we go-Down that rabbithole.   But my issues is that he is stubborn, prideful and does not want me to tell him no or advise against what he wants to do. We argue and from reading posts and comments, I know I’ve got to stop that because he doesn’t hear the perfectly valid reason he just wants what he wants and to hell with the consequences. It’s stressful because after his second stroke in 3 years he is a shell of himself. he is only interested in his 3 meals a day, his walking /exercises , movies, YouTube and naps. We manage as best we can, he doesnt drive anymore and I willnot let him near the stove after a few mishaps, we can’t afford help. I miss my husband, he was my closest friend. I miss our conversations and get togethers with family and friends. He forgets a lot, can’t recall words or generally gets lost in a conversation and feels embarrassed, so we see very few people. He tells me everyday, love you dear, but he also says that to his favorite waitress at the local joint he goes to once a month. After his 2nd TIA, mini-stroke, I began to take over the finances and that’s when I learned that so much had been forgotten, unpaid or just lost. So now, along with taking care of him, I’ve got to work, pay bills, work out arrears with IRS and work to lower credit card balances. It’s frustrating because we talked each month about bills and when he said things were getting paid, I believed him. Now he says he was overwhelmed or he forgot. This from a former CPA, who was a whiz with numbers.  I discovered boxes of unopened bills and mail just stacked in his home office. He took on contract work every now and then. But he hasn’t had any work for a while and I didn’t even know. He was just there looking at movies and youtube I guess. i really don’t know anymore. We would be fine as long as we lived within our budget, but he continues to spend and forgets that he ordered something. I was fussing with him today because he bought $100 worth of walking shorts and he will not be able to wear shorts for months. So why now. Ughhh, this is so frustrating. I will have to find a way to limit his purchases but he keeps all this info to himself and he wants to open new accounts all the time. How can this stop? Feel like I’m just digging deeper in a hole.",1
"This post concerns my mother in law and the issues we’ve had trying to get her the medical help she needs.

My MIL (mid 60s) has been displaying signs of memory loss for the past few years, but it has progressed over the last 2 years or so.  She has gotten lost in our home, gotten lost while driving in her hometown, cannot effectively strung together thoughts and articulate sentences, can’t order for herself from a menu, etc.  The issue is quite noticeable. 

My wife and her sister have been urging their stepfather (late 40s) to take MIL to a doctor to evaluate and get a diagnosis.  He is ultra anti-medicine and has come up with every excuse why she shouldn’t be diagnosed. “Don’t want her to be doped up on meds.  Don’t want her to be depressed over diagnosis.  Don’t want her to be subject to tests like a lab rat, etc.”  Wife and sister in law have tried explaining that they’re not advocating for pushing meds if MIL doesn’t want to take them.  We just need to know what we’re dealing with and consult a doctor to best plan for the future. 

What’s worse, MIL is left alone for hours every week while FIL is out working.  What if she leaves the house and gets lost?  Sets the house on fire after forgetting about oven? Etc. Even members of FIL’s family (some of which are medical professionals) have urged him to seek medical care for her, which he refused. 

Everything blew up over the last few days when wife and sister in law got into a huge argument with their stepfather about the situation.  MIL didn’t even know what the argument was about, but insisted she was “fine”.  Has anyone experienced anything like this?  No one thinks that a diagnosis will be “magic fix” but at the very least it’s a starting point.",1
"Father in law, 77, lifelong smoker... Question : he has always been quite 'centre of attention' with his speech, but he now walks around saying ""well yeah, well yeah, you try your best don't you, well yeah, well yeah, do that now, well yeah"". He's able to cook, wash, clothe himself etc... Just the dialogue. Our memory clinic appointment was cancelled before Christmas, but we just wondered if such self talk was a very strong symptom of tough times to come?",1
"TLDR; mom with dementia throws insults at us on holiday. Don’t think she’ll come on holiday with us anymore- which is sad . 


My (26F) mom(62 F) has had dementia for nearly 10 years now. My husband and I moved to London this year and my family decided to visit for Christmas. It was a nice thought and I think we were optimistic and a bit naive in how it would all go down. 

In summary she yells a lot at night. And not just once; I mean throughout the night for a good maybe 3 -4hours. This is after having given her her meds. Apparently it doesn’t usually get this bad. I think it’s just so different to home. 

Next, she accuses us of causing her memory loss. She used to blame my dad but he died of cancer at the beginning of the year. 

She then accuses us of somehow causing my dads death. That he didn’t have a problem (he had anger management issues and was quite physically abusive to the rest of my family but me- it did calm down though) , it was all us. 

It sucks because all of this hurts so much, but at the same time I can’t confront her because when she’s in this mode, she really goes for the jugular and you’ll just go in circles. Also she’s going to forget. 

I’ve read a lot of advice saying that you shouldn’t be confrontational, remind them of what they did, try to diffuse the situation which all makes sense. It’s just so hard because in a normal situation if you have a misunderstanding with someone you’d talk about it. But now I can’t. I just take it. I mean I sit in a different room to her but she yells really loudly. 

My sister is suggesting that next time we just bring one of her caregivers and I get that she’s thinking more of the principle of not leaving her out but at the same time what’s the point if we’re all not going to enjoy , she’s going to be distressed and we hear all these insults along the way. 

It’s sucks that this is the same person who was completely different. I would have never imagined that this would happen.",1
"This is so monumental, scary and sad and it was only decided this morning! She’s been ill the last two days and can’t hold her own weight!

Sitting with her now and she has no idea how the day is going to pan out, that last night was her last night sleeping in her own bed!

Just waiting to hear from the care home! Telling ourself it’s only a week’s respite. I truly believe she’ll be happier in the long run. One of our carers has advised me to tell her ‘we’ve found a lovely place for you to convalesce in, just for the week to get your strength back’, not to mention a care home at all!!

Thank you for this amazing community. I’ll keep you posted in the hope it will help someone else here!",1
"We are still working to get a diagnosis for my grandmother (85) but her PCP and I are operating under the assumption that she has Dementia. For a month or so, she was in her home. My uncle lives there, but is an alcoholic that depended on her for his own care. So for a month, I was there 7x a week, sometimes twice a day to do her daily living. He provided no assistance to her, so we were forced to care for them both. 

Around 3 weeks ago, she slipped out of the house with thoughts of self-harm and was hospitalized with COVID/ for the self-harm. The doctors at the hospital recommended that she move to a skilled nursing facility as she scored very low on her hospital cognitive exams. We were able to arrange for her to move to a SNF 5 miles from my home. The social worker there preformed a cognitive that she did well on, and now they say she doesn't qualify to stay there. Even though cognitively she scored well, she is still very confused, unable to get around well, and unable to care for herself at all. She makes too much money for Medicaid, but not enough to pay for Assisted Living or self-pay at the SNF. 

So, we have no choice but go move her in with me. I am fortunate to work from home, but in order to pay my own bills I have to continue working full-time while caring for her. Right now, she can use the restroom pretty independently aside from accidents and needing support walking there. Nearly everything else she needs help with. I cook for her, shower, dress, administer meds, etc. She is also a flight risk, so we have added dementia proof door locks and will be unable to ever leave her at home alone for her own safety. We've purchased a caregiver pager so I'll be alerted anytime help is needed so i can try to sleep when I can. 

My family doesn't seem to understand how bad things are and how much is going in to moving her here. I love my grandma and would do anything for her, but I'm 28. I don't feel like I'm equipped to take care of her, and constantly feel like I'm letting her down. Her insurance won't cover any assistance for me at home, and the local area agency on aging will only help with a shower aid, which there is a long long wait list for. 

I guess I just wanted to get some support/ suggestions on things I need to know starting out on this journey. Aside from the aspects of daily living, I'm worried she'll refuse meds and doing exercises like she's been at the SNF. I'm also worried that since I'll be working, I won't be able to keep her engaged to prevent sundowning. I just hope I can meet her needs 24/7.",1
"Hey everyone,

  I've posted here a few times and people respond.  I don't reply to everyone but I do appreciate all of them.  Just wanted to say that just in case I forgot to later.

Bit of a scare tonight.  My mom was on the commode and suddenly stopped responding to me, then started going limp.  If I hadn't been there she would have fallen off the commode.

I lifted her up and held her as she sat on the bed.  She was still limp and now her eyes rolled back.  I called out for my sister since she was up.  She came into the room as quickly as she could.

Something like this had happened before(many months ago) so after the initial shock of seeing her pass out wore off I relaxed a bit and just kept an eye on her.  Laid her down and have been sitting here about half an hour.  Will try and sleep soon.  Today will be all out of whack because I haven't even slept yet.  My sister does what she can but has significant health problems so all the lifting and moving, medications, bathing,  I take care of all that.

Just needed to say something about this.  Also I guess it's a bit of advice for others dealing with dementia patients.  You may not see something like this coming.  I was sitting there holding my mom's hand one minute, the next I'm worried something is seriously wrong.

Sometimes dementia patients, if they sit on the commode or toilet too long, it can aggravate a certain nerve.  I forget the name of the nerve, but it's supposedly pretty common.

She's alright now, fast asleep and breathing strongly.  This has me thinking about ""what happens next"" and I realize I don't know.  I have no idea how to handle those things.  Depressing.

I'll stop here.  Thanks for reading, and if you comment and I don't reply please don't think I'm ignoring you or didn't appreciate you taking a few minutes to say something.  If you are dealing with someone with dementia too, my heart goes out to you.  Some days are easier than others.",1
"I can't take this any more. This column will be probably scribble-scrabble, and ""woe is me,"" but I have to get this out of my system or I will scream.

My mother has severe dementia and my father keeps waffling on her care. He says he will send her to a memory care unit at a nursing home, then he says he will get 24-hour nursing care for her, then he says he will take care of her himself. He and my mother are both in their 80s. I can't stand that he won't make a decision.

About 3 years ago when her mother (my grandmother) was dying, she began showing signs of dementia at that time. I asked my dad to have an appointment made to have her tested. He made the appointments and she refused to go, saying, ""That's not a can of worms you want to open!""

I begged him and begged him to PLEASE get her some help. He pretty much ignored me, despite my asking over and again. As a former CNA at a hospital, I've seen the kind of hell that caregivers go through with dementia patients.

Over that time she has gotten worse; and then this past summer, after a gall bladder operation, she crashed and burned, losing her mind almost totally.

My mother and her family have pretty much screwed my life over with one of her sisters molesting me (costing me $$$ and hours of therapy over 40 years). She ran to take care of her family before my father--at one point she told my father not to make her choose between her marriage and her family when they crooked their little fingers and she ran to see to them first.

""Forgive, forgive, forgive"" is the constant refrain that I hear from the Church and family and friends. But I can't. That ship has LONG sailed. And now I'm getting to where I can't stand the father who has suffered so much on her account by her ignoring his needs--and he won't put her in a dementia care nursing home where she can get the medical care and therapy she needs.

He had a chance to put her there a couple of months back and he wouldn't; he kept telling me ""I wasn't ready."" I lost my temper and asked him, ""Were you doing this for YOUR good or HERS?"" He has long-term care insurance for both himself and my mother, and he just WON'T get her into the dementia care unit at the nursing home. I can't STAND THIS anymore.

So I'm getting ready to pick up and leave the state to accept a job almost a thousand miles away. If he wants to take care of her all on his own, so be it. I've done all the talking I can do, and offered all the help I can do. I can do no more.

And frankly, if my father weren't here? I'd just put her in the nursing home and let her alone. She didn't stop her sister from molesting me; she didn't stop her family from making fun of me. All of this has caused me so much pain and CPTSD down the years.

The commandment says to ""Honor thy father and mother."" But frankly, I don't see how I can or why I should.

There...I've said what I feel. I can do no more. And I'm leaving.",1
"My mom has been living with us for the last year or so. Over the course of her that, since her diagnosis, she's been hoarding things that she'll randomly buy at HomeGoods or Target. When she was driving, we'd let her just buy whatever since it kept her happy and occupied

Money is getting a bit tighter now, so I've been collecting and hiding all of these things (pans, dish towels, glasses) with the idea that I'd return them. 

Instead, I just wrapped and gave them to her as her christmas gift. We were dying, cause they were the PERFECT gifts. Each time she opened one, she was wide-eyed about how well we chose for her.",1
"My grandfather is suffering from dementia that we believe was brought on by congestive heart failure around 2 years ago.  He's still independent and functional, able to recall random new memories but he also forgets a lot.  The dementia doesn't seem to have progressed much since he was put on heart medication.  It hasn't been much of a concern until last Thursday, we were forced to euthanize his dog.  He's now stuck in a loop, discovering that his baby girl is gone every 15 to 20 minutes.  He remembered that my aunt came down for christmas and her husband wasn't able to make it, but he seems to be in denial about the dog.  It's like his brain refuses to accept it.  He calls me and my mom 2-3 time an hour looking for his dog, finding out for the ""first time"" she was put down, reliving the emotions again and again.  We've put up pictures of Honey and a note explaining what was wrong with her, what happened and why we had to do it, hoping that would help.  It doesn't seem to be working.  

Is there any way we can get it to sink in?  Should we lie to him about the dog?  Seeing him live this way has me worried this will cause him to go down hill fast and its having a huge emotional impact on the family.  Any help is greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.",1
"Hi,
I’m visiting my parents. Dad has dementia, he can still dress himself etc and is fairly independent but mom has to make sure to feed him, give him his myriad of pills multiple times a day, drive him almost everywhere, etc. He is sometimes fine, but other times doesn’t know what time of year it is, and he definitely can’t be left alone all day or over night.  

A few months ago my mom had an emergency and had to go to the ER (I think my dad drove her). For multiple days he was without his medications and didn’t know who to call. Both of their phones died and I had no way of knowing what happened or getting in touch with either of them.


Recently my dad has begun to forget how to text, answer, or use his cell phone (*except* Facebook, which is a whole other problem). In the event of an emergency, if mom falls or has another heart attack, I don’t know if he’d be able to dial 911 on a cell. He’d have to drive her to a hospital and hopefully not get lost. 

They have a landline phone still attached to their wall, but it hasn’t been in service in so many years since they got cell phones.  Last time they had it in use, it must’ve been through their cable company because the incoming call numbers would appear on their tv screen, which was incredibly annoying. 


I’d like to have a landline service but have it only be able to make out bound calls (911 only would be fine) and NO incoming calls, because dad has fallen prey to scammers multiple times before. I believe he’d know how to dial 911 on the landline because the phone is still in the same spot as it was 20+ years ago. He doesn’t try to use it (that I’ve seen), probably partly because he doesn’t remember anyone’s number or how to find their number. But in case of emergency, I’d like the option to be there. 

I live across the country. No one I know still has a landline, I don’t know if it’s even a service anymore. I had heard that the FCC/ providers are supposedly getting rid of landline services altogether. Mom knows their home internet and cable service name, but not her log in. In googling I see something called “Community Phone” which uses some sort of internet router. I don’t know if this is a scam, either. 


Even if there was a giant red button that said “THIS WILL CALL 911 IF YOU PRESS IT” I don’t think we could train his brain to keep that info new info in there especially should an emergency arise. Even a Jitterbug would be too “new”. I’m shocked and impressed he’s able to use an iPhone as well as he currently does. 

Anyway, anyone know anything about landlines??? I know a lot of folks have problems with their loved ones making inappropriate calls out, but all I want is outgoing and no incoming (or at least a way to silence the ringer and not have it show up on the tv screen).",1
"Mom’s been in the secure wing for a month now.   A resident (Ms C) was crying and sobering, not understanding why she cannot leave.  It was heartbreaking.   She was roommate with mom for awhile until mom tried to escape.   And then recently, Ms C tried to escape as well and had to be moved to the secured wing. 

Dad in moving into LTC as well (but not for dementia). Unable to control his bowels.   Falling almost daily.  Barely able to stand or walk for a couple of steps before collapsing of fatigue.  

My partner’s father passed suddenly (many years ago) due to heart attack, at a relative young age.  I often wonder what’s more cruel? A sudden unexpected passing, a shock to the whole family.  Then having to process it all, the lost of a love one so unexpectedly.   

Or the long dragging out of the inevitable.  Watching your parent unable to fed themselves, weak, bedridden, slowly losing their mind and body.

"I’ve always had an extremely close relationship with my father. I had a middle class upbringing in a factory town in the Midwest and to be Frank it’s a pretty depressing area of the country. It was always my fathers dream for his kids to get an education and see life outside of that town. I ended up getting my degree and a couple years later I moved to my dream city and it’s been nothing short of amazing. There are so many things me and my partner are passionate about that we are not able to do in our home town. Also I recently found out my partner is pregnant, and I want nothing more than to give the child an amazing life. 

Fast forward to a week ago, my father (57) was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. I’m completely torn on whether I should move home (2,500 miles away) to be there for my father in those precious years he has ahead of him while his symptoms are relatively mild. One piece of me feels like the biggest dream I’ve ever had for myself, partner, and child will die with that decision. The other side of me feels like I could never live with myself if I stayed out here during this period. 

I’m wondering if anyone on here has had a similar situation and if they have any advice? Or regrets with one decision or the other.

My dad is 64. He has worked in the boating industry for 45 years. For the first few decades, safety concerns were not there. He inhaled (and still does) many many VOCs. He’s also a chronic marijuana smoker and drinks a bit much. Though he’s always functioned well and built his own successful business (which I, his son, now own half of).
I am concerned that he may have the beginnings of dementia. I look at symptom lists online and he checks 80-90% of the items.
He’s also a fairly angry person and does not handle outside input well. To him, it’s often seen as a challenge (his words).
I’ve mentioned this to my mother who is terrified of considering this possibility and prefers to shrug his presumed symptoms off. I’m low-key afraid for her safety as he can be very volatile. Though, he’s never hit her, to my knowledge.
How do I go about 1) determining if my concerns are well founded or if this is just his normal personality? 2) getting him the help he needs (if any at all) without robbing him of his dignity?
His doctor wouldn’t give him a basic cognitive test during their last visit because his psychiatrist is changing and his meds likely will, too. They said a cog test would be a waste until that stuff was sorted.",1
"My Dad was diagnosed with ""mixed dementia"" in Nov 2020.  

Coincidentally, his brother died from Lewy Body Dementia 8 years ago.  

I know LBD isn't necessarily hereditary, but I've read if someone in your family has had it, it simply increases your chances.  

My Dads illness recently took a sharp turn.   Almost 2 months ago, he suddenly stopped sleeping.  We tried all kinds of things, and he barely slept night after night.  This went on for a whole month before we were able to get prescribed a low dose anti anxiety medication to help him sleep.    

He complains he's hot one minute, then cold the next.   He has essential tremors.   He's constantly dizzy.  Constantly confused.  There's no memory loss yet, just confusion.  He sleeps on and off all day long now.  For hours at a time.   He is highly anxious and doesn't want my mom to leave to go anywhere.   If she does happen to step out to get groceries while I stay and watch him, he gets really mad at her and says ""what took you so long?? You were gone for hours?"" Meanwhile she was only gone for 20-30 mins.   Now he complains he has a stomach ache almost every day.  

His condition literally nosedived in what seems like overnight and he's only 2 years in on his diagnosis.  

He has an appt with the Geriatric Assessment Intervention Network (GAIN CLINIC) this Friday.  They are going to assess him head to toe.  

He has an appointment with his heart doctor on Jan 11. So he's being assessed there too.  

He has an appt with a geriatric psychiatrist on Feb 2 to address his anxiety.  

But all these symptoms point to LBD.  I'm sure he has other types too. 

But isn't LBD the fastest most progressive one? Otherwise how did his condition literally nose dive practically overnight???

It's so hard.  He's literally a shell of a man now.",1
"My father’s dementia and Parkinson’s symptoms (probable Dementia with Lewy Bodies) have progressed very quickly in 2 years and he is no longer capable of independently taking care of himself. I recently moved him from his home to Assisted Living. Within days of arriving, the care team wanted him to transfer to the Memory Care section. Once there, they began explaining that he does not meet retention requirements and they may soon have to serve a 30-day notice to leave. They specifically said that they cannot keep sending multiple people to his room to physically help him in/out of bed and his chair. At home he had one, very patient aide, who did not need any other help and usually just waited for him to be ready to move. 

I called a nursing home where he was on a waiting list (originally told 2-3 months). I learned that since he is no longer coming from home, he is now put on a different waiting list for transfers. This list is even longer (4-6 months). Many nursing homes will not accept his application because he neither qualifies for Medicaid, nor does he have cash assets available to pay for one year of expenses. Good chance selling his home may change this, but no guarantees due to drop in housing market. 

His house (hours away) is emptied out and is being prepared to sell. I have teenagers in my already small home and no room for him. It took me 4 months to get him into Assisted Living and it seems to me that I can’t do anything in 30 days if provided with that notice. His previous application for a different memory care facility was rejected due to the need for assisted transfers (same issue current facility is claiming). The application for the one nursing home has been shelved and they now want a referral from the existing facility to put him on the transfer waiting list.

"TLDR: how did you get your parent to the doctor for the diagnosis?

&#x200B;

I think he has dementia. 

He is naturally stubborn and has hated the doctor my entire life, and before.

There has been a serious shift these past few weeks. I moved back to the city I was raised in a year ago and the reality really hit on the 24th of Dec. My mother was talking about how her marriage is really suffering and she was talking about my father. I have been thinking something was wrong since I moved back to LA and would gently mention dementia has a possibility to my mother to no avail. 

My mother is wildly suicidal now and my brothers are not helpful. I have 3 and only talk to 1. They are all older. 

My father is taking to me the best because I just agree to him and try to keep him occupied with little tasks that I know he enjoys. 

He has to go to the doctor. I was going to book an appointment for late tomorrow and talk to the doctor before hand over the phone. I am planning on asking him to go to the doctor because I have been noticing some worrying signs, but emphasize that it's probably nothing, but him going will really ease my fears. I think I may mention that when I was looking up drug reactions from his medication it may be causing some of the issues, but once again emphasize it's probably nothing and him going to the doctor will make me happy.

"So my mom just hit 50 a few months ago, and she's always had kind of a poor memory. But lately, she's been forgetting things that are more than just where she parked or whether or not she locked the door. Last week, she couldn't remember if she picked up my sister from school or not. She literally had just got back from doing so. She frequently pauses mid sentence and loses her place or stops the conversation entirely and acts surprised when you ask her to continue. She also has a very hard time remembering what happened in the previous episode of any TV shows we watch, or even events that happen earlier in the episode we are currently watching.

Just about 20 minutes ago, she let the dog outside to pee, then about 5 minutes later was walking around the house calling her name, asking everyone where the dog was. She walked over to the window and saw her outside, then scolded my sister for letting the dog out and not letting her back in. Both my sister and I explained to her that she was the one to let the dog out, and she genuinely denied it and said it had to be me or my sister. This was the final straw for me, I'm starting to actually become worried about her.

She is being treated and is on medication. I am an only child.

We moved 500 miles away about 7 months ago and I have only seen her in person about 2x since then. However,  every time I see her she sits me down for A Talk About Her Memory as if we haven't had the discussion before. I gently remind her that I know about it but that doesn't stop her from telling me all of what is going on and doing it the same way she first told me which I felt like was an ambush.  So I get this ambushed feeling everytime she sits me down and frankly I am wanting to avoid being alone with her to get out of the Talk. 

For some background,  I have always been uncomfortable talking with her about her feelings (and mine) because she has either been hesitant to talk about things or she swings in the other direction and gets very emotional. I dislike both options. 

I need to reframe this because I don't know how long she  has and will be even remotely herself. 

Thanks!",1
"My father is 67, In the last few years he's been a bit more forgetful of things. The last couple months he's became alot more forgetful. Calls me into his room to tell me something, totally forgets what he was going to ask/tell. There's a handful of times where he just can't remember what he's talking about or going to do.

Today he came downstairs with his cup to make coffee and forgot why he was down here and started looking in the fridge. He was telling my fiancee about something we have that she could make but he forgot what it was. She mentioned something he may have been talking about and he started telling her how to make it and forgot the word triangle and just made the shape woth his hand. 

Now granted he's been using delta 8 recently (a form of THC) for his joint pain, so I'm thinking that could be a factor with it but I'm not sure.

The one problem I'm having here is he hates doctors and hospitals, no matter what I've tried in the past he will not go. So it will be tough to have him checked out.

Does this sound like possible dementia? Any tips on how I should go about getting him to see a doctor?",1
" My wife’s grandfather (let’s call him Mark) was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s a year ago. It was a big shock for our family as my wife is very close to him, and so am I. The diagnosis didn’t ring true for us for some time, he seemed like the same loveable, joyful and funny man we had always known. The progression was slow at first, he would forget little things and we didn’t notice much of a difference for several months, but he has been getting worse with time, as expected. He used to do his own groceries, go for a walk in the morning, visit my sister-in-law who lives just a few blocks again and so on. But now, he seems to return from a regular walk later than usual. Even though he denies, we are sure he has been having troubles remembering his way back home. We live around 30min away from him. We had a family meeting and our biggest concern was how to act in case of an emergency.

A few months ago I learned about an app called Fenomy, that can be used in emergency situations. Mark is still able to use his phone, but this would work even if he wasn’t. Basically, we created a circle with our family and some friends who live in the area. We established a “safe perimeter”, which means we’ll all get an alarm if he goes somewhere that exceeds the area we selected. This alarm can also be triggered by him, just pressing a button or though a voice command. The same alarm notification will be sent to all the people in our circle, showing his location and coordinates. We can see when someone accepts his emergency request, so we can be calmer because we know someone reliable is going to help. Another important feature is that the alarm can be automatically triggered in case of physical inactivity for a certain period of time, and his location can be requested by anyone in our circle. All the features can be found on their [website](https://fenomy.com/). We all think this is extremely useful and important, I have tried it before, and I would definitely recommend it.

We don’t have a caregiver yet, but we plan to hire one in the future and add them to our circle. I spent the whole day yesterday trying to find more apps and other technologies that can help us during this difficult time. I found some apps that target cognitive skills practice and other types of support, as Train Your Brain, MindMate, Lumosity, MOJO. Has anyone used any of these or other apps/technologies that has proved to be helpful for you? Do you have any other suggestions and ideas on how technology can help people with Alzheimer’s?

Edit: some misspelled words.",1
"As my mom's dementia is progressing, I'm feeling more hurt and kind of left out. Today, because she got confused about what our Christmas day plans were (which we went over multiple times this week) she missed our family Christmas meal with her grandkids at my home because she instead made plans to eat at her assisted living facility...with the same friends that she sees and eats every meal with every day. Wouldn't change her plans when we brought up the miscommunication. She said I never told her. So instead of her coming over 10-2ish, she came at 10, watched the kids open presents ""from her"" that I bought, was nervous and pacing after 45 minutes, and i took her back. No apology from her, I didn't press the issue because I didn't want to upset her. Probably told her friends I rushed her home. Maybe she doesn't want more time with us. Her plans sure felt like they were made out of spite. 

I'm tired of feeling like the bad guy, and tired of feeling like there's no one to be mad at because of the dementia. I feel like I'll just be the scapegoat, the one who's at fault when something like this inevitably happens again, until she just no longer recognizes me.

I understand the why, the progression, I'm glad she has routine helping her, has a place to live where she feels safe, and has friends...tho she has started losing them lately as she becomes more irritable and misunderstands more.

I don't know how to fully express my complex feelings... but I guess I just wanted to share with others who might understand what I'm going through. I didn't realize that last Christmas was our last semblance of a family Christmas together.

How was your Christmas?",1
"i just need to rant i guess. this was the first year where my grandfather has been completely unaware it's christmas, and it's the first christmas without my grandmother too. in many ways, it feels like a loss of two people. i've sort of accepted things but it's still so, so hard. 

visiting him in his nursing home today wasn't too bad honestly but at the same time he seemed completely unaware of everything. i don't know if that's for the best or not but i just feel bad for him. the nurses were nice enough to let us into one of their open areas with him which we appreciated because he often tries to leave his room when we visit. 

he remembered my name a few times too which made me really happy. even before he started to decline, he would often get my name mixed up with my cousins, so the fact he remembers at all now makes me so happy. i really love him so much he basically raised me it's so sad and scary to watch him decline each time we visit

no one has to reply to this i just wanna get my thoughts out. thanks if you read this",1
"Hi, 

My grandmother has been suffering from dementia for the past 7-8 years. It started quite sudden, and after scans it turned out she had suffered from a series of cerebral microbleeds / microhemorrhages. Heart and vascular disease is rife on her side of the family, so she's been on meds for probably 40 years (multiple heart attacks) to control blood pressure etc. He mother, brother, and sister both died from Alzheimer's - but her case is very different from those (I witnessed all three pass from Alzheimer's) 

It started with forgetfulness, paranoia, and the usual list of things. 

Then she started hiding stuff in the weirdest places, started doing things many times over (checking if the doors were locked, etc.), and became more apathetic. 

For the past 6-12 months, she's pretty much stopped doing anything. She's spending most of her days sleeping. Mostly restless sleep. She only eats when we more or less force her to. She barely speaks, and apathy is in full effect. She has no concept of time, and thinking is confined to the present. If she's asked anything at all, she just gives up and tries to shoo us away. 

She's also developed unsteady gait - but it's hard to tell if it's because she's sleeping all day. 

I honestly can't see this going on for much longer. Especially with the lack of eating in mind. And she's been having more problems with her heart for the past year, so doctors have tried to adjust her meds multiple times. 

Anyone here experienced with vascular dementia - and especially toward the end stages of it?",1
"I'd like to know your experiences with how you or the doctors decided end of life care was necessary. Generally online it says when verbal communication is basically gone, immobile, can't dress or eat on their own or perhaps can't swallow at all, incontinence, and if the patient is expected to live less than 6 months.

What was your loved one experiencing when hospice became the best option? It seems difficult to determine with a disease like dementia and I'm beginning to plan what the next steps for my loved one will be.",1
"She choked on some food and was having difficulty breathing. They managed to get it out in theatre but she has some in her lungs so they are keeping her in overnight. 

This disease is truly awful.

Just venting to people who understand.",1
"MIL (recently diagnosed with dementia) has been falling for scams a lot lately, usually involving her giving her debit card info out - which is not fun to deal with, but easy enough to fix by marking the charges as fraudulent and getting her a new card.

Today the scammers took it to the next level: they called her pretending to be Google saying something was wrong with her account, and she was tricked into giving them her email password. Of course they changed it and now we're spending Christmas morning trying to reset the password and reclaim ownership.

Thankfully all of her important accounts were moved to a separate email months ago so they won't be able to access her financial info or anything like that. Still a huge pain, and infuriating that the scammers are targeting the elderly on Christmas of all days.",1
"How does one get a family member tested for dementia. Last year, my grandmas doctor suggested we speak to a social worker and the appt has been scheduled a couple of times but it’s just been canceled, cause it’s exhausting dealing with this on my own when she has three grown children, who won’t take charge and help their mom, like I do.

They had a fire, well more smoke damage in their home at the start of November. She had put a plastic cutting board in the oven, thinking it was a cookie sheet for the pizza she was trying to cook. Even after arguing with my grandpa about it. He is upset with himself about the situation. After the fire the family surprisingly showed up and took over making sure the cleaners did a good job & washed all their dishes cause I didn’t have time to do that. 

I would like my grandma to go talk to this social worker, just so I know how to help her and support her and my grandpa.  

Any suggestions on how to convince my grandma to go. This summer she was put on anxiety meds, which has helped, she doesn’t call me as much as she use too. I have access too all her medical stuff.",1
My dad's 67 and had a stroke 4 years ago and slowly start becoming like this where he  's somewhat like him self during the day but when it gets dark/night time he would become quite irratic and forgetful. He'd often repeat a lot of stuff and doesn't remember the answers I gave to him a few minutes ago so I'd end up repeating the exact same conversation 3-4 times before he stop.  He also forgets where he leaves his phone and keys quite often as well. He also gets my name mixed up with my uncle quite often and sometime calls me by my uncles name even if im infront of him. There's also a lot more but these are the one that all my family notice.  I tried to talk to him about it and try to get him to check up but he's quite adamant about not going and thinks I'm just bullshitting him potentially having dementia or some sort of issue. Any advice would be appreciated,1
"i’m F18 and my mom has early onset alzheimer’s. i spent a week at my boyfriends house last week and had such a nice christmas with his family and now being here with my mom is making me so depressed i’m gonna cry. she doesn’t remember any of our christmas eve / evening traditions, and i keep reminding her of what we do on christmas morning but she doesn’t want to do any of it. it just makes me sad because i didn’t know last christmas would be the last one that felt real. it’s just me and her and with her refusing to do any christmas stuff and me having to help her get my own gifts i’m just so incredibly depressed. 
i don’t even know if i’m really looking for advice here, i just need to vent about this. all she wants to do is sit and watch TV and i don’t get to have christmas with her anymore. i’m just too young to have lost both my parents and i can’t stand watching my mom fade away especially during the holidays. 
i was planning on staying in town with her until january 12 but i don’t think i can make it that long with how miserable i feel. But at the same time i feel guilty for leaving early. she’ll be with her family and they take good care of her but i still feel stuck.",1
"I hope this post won't be painful for anyone here. My mother is in memory care, with early-stage dementia. She's 99 and still ""herself"". We can have philosophical conversations and she knows who everyone is, but she doesn't remember what happened yesterday, and she sundowns. She's aware her memory is going and can express what it feels like.

I am guessing if she's alive next year, she will have progressed significantly. As you look back on the last holiday your loved one was ""all there"", what would you have said or done if you'd known? I don't want to get to next year and have regrets. If your experience taught you something about this, would you be willing to share it here? I'm hoping a post like this can help others, too.",1
"This disease is so exhausting. After much debate, my family decided we’d bring my LO to one of our homes for a low key Christmas Eve lunch. Her (baby) great-granddaughter she’s never met is visiting from overseas, along with her only grandson whom she hasn’t seen in over 3 years. We made our plan (food, timing, attendance) fully centered around her, told her memory care facility about it last week, and my partner and I drove 30 minutes on ice covered roads to retrieve her in the midst of our own holiday preparations and plans. 

Guess what? She refused to come. She was completely disheveled when I walked in, crying and carrying on about how she’d “slit [her] throat” if she couldn’t see her grandson and great-granddaughter while they are visiting, but also insisting they couldn’t see her “like this.” It was sad, but also infuriating, especially as she continued to try to hold me up from leaving, despite simultaneously saying she didn’t feel well enough to see anyone. The large bouquet I brought her also went completely unnoticed.

So what’s the point of this post? I guess just because I need to vent. And also to let those of you who’ve chosen not to visit or take your LO out for the holidays know that you shouldn’t feel guilty and probably made a wise decision.

Bah humbug.",1
"Hey, I’m 20, and my grandmother with dementia has been living with my family for the past couple years. It is HARD. I feel so bad saying this about my own grandmother whom I love dearly, but she makes home life really damn hard. She has nothing to do all day because we are all busy with our own lives. We have been trying to get her placed into a care facility but haven’t succeeded so far. Every time I walk by her she acts like I haven’t seen her in a while and pushes me to kiss and hug her. I sound like a jerk, but it’s just too much everyday. when I’m in a rush or just trying to go about my day to be stopped and basically guilted into hugging and kissing her when I don’t want to. I don’t do that with my parents or other family. She is incredibly loving, and I’m grateful for her, but she also has a tremendous amount of trouble following conversations. So we can’t have natural enjoyable exchanges around her because she needs everything repeated. But she’s always around. All of us are stressed and I’m home from college and can’t connect with my parents or relax because of this. I hate it so much. The worst part of it all is my mom talks about how she is going to be affected by dementia as well, and she is quite older than me so I might be going through this again. I’m just endlessly stressed because of this. How the heck should I deal with this?",1
"My mother has this recurrent story about how one of her family members stole one of her special pins. It was a very very special pin she says. She has dozens of pins but not this one that a certain family member “took” and she “wants it back now!”

This story has occurred intermittently over the past few years but currently she is very focused on it and it is a daily issue. And now when she starts talking about it additional items are being added onto the list of things taken from her. Agh!

I know the accusation of stealing is a frequent theme for people with dementia. In the past, I was able to deflect and redirect, but it’s seemingly impossible now. We can have a full conversation for another 20 minutes, take a walk, brush our teeth, have a close inspection of some object that is close by, and yet she comes back to this topic again!

The worst part is that this recurrent confabulation seems to be making her more and more unhappy. She’s talking about cutting off family and not attending family events, etc. and spends time alone crying about it. Very sad.

Any suggestions? I’m at the point honestly where I just want to scream at her and tell her the truth and it would be very mean, but I really don’t want to do that obviously.",1
"So recently, my dad (81) was diagnosed with vascular dementia and early alzheimer's. He's somewhere between a 3/4, so his memory is still (fairly) okay, he's able to do some yard work, but we can see it's starting to get a little worse and he's definitely starting to become paranoid about things (spousal cheating/conspiring against him).

Currently it's myself, my brother, my mom, and him, plus our two dogs and my sister living nearby. I'm planning on moving in with my partner across the country next year, but I'm worried about him. I plan on bringing my dogs, and my concern is that the loss of having me and the dogs around might make things worse. He would still have my brother and mom around all the time and my sister visits at least once a week, but me moving out is going to be a big change. Any advice to make it as smooth a transition as possible?",1

My parents and I have been arguing all month, my mental, emotional, and physical health have taken a trip to the dumpster and sometimes I feel as if my entire life has died along with her. I'm spending Christmas even in a hotel with my fiancé and our dog and cat. It's peaceful without all the family drama pressure, but I still feel empty inside.

She is incontinent, feeds herself but in a mess , now getting angry and needs to be sedated either for fighting another resident in her memory care home or fighting showers.

"Hi everyone. I've never really used Reddit all that much, so I apologize if I'm doing anything incorrectly, but I really need some advice. This is going to be long. There will be mentions of suicidal ideation and animal abuse.

So, my father has dementia and I have no idea what to do. I am 22 and he first started showing signs when I was in middle school, so he would've been in his early 60s or so. I've been told by my mom (66) that his mother also suffered from dementia in her 50s, but hers apparently was significantly worse. She for the most part was nonverbal and wasn't really aware of her surroundings or the people around her. When she was admitted to a nursing home/psych ward (this is how my mom described it), she frequently tried escaping and would have severe episodes of what I would assume is psychosis. I'm sure that the ""treatment"" she endured wasn't exactly effective or humane which probably worsened her condition, but I do know for a fact that her condition prior to treatment was very bad. I've tried getting more information out of my mom about her, but talking about it seems to upset her. Since she's really the only person in my family who I can talk to about this, I won't force her to talk. I also have two older sisters who are 32 and 34, but my father has ruined practically all of my family connections since no one wants anything to do with him, so I can't really go to them for help. 

I've always had a horrible relationship with my father. He's been an extremely narcissistic, manipulative asshole his entire life. He never gave a shit about me or my hobbies (like showing up to my orchestra concerts or musicals) and wasn't afraid to tell me so. Even when I was a child and broke my leg, he told my family that I was being dramatic and let it go for three days untreated. I've heard him talking about me and my family members behind our backs when he thought no one was listening. He's accused me of taking his meds when he was the one misusing them (before his dementia was detected). I've been trying desperately for the past month to think of any positive childhood memories I have with my father but I can't come up with any.

Now that he has dementia, I have no idea what to do or how to feel. He's still acts the same way, but the dementia has made him more miserable. He can barely speak, write, or understand questions. He has no sense of personal hygiene. He sneaks out of the house to drive which often leads to him getting lost or getting into accidents. We've tried hiding the keys, but he always manages to find them. He has applied duct tape on our entire roof, windows and doors because he was worried about rain. He has forgotten who I am and asked how long I have been living with my parents. He has beaten our pets out of frustration. He genuinely thinks that his wife is his mother. He's just an entirely different human being and I don't know what I should do. Any time me or my mom try to talk gently talk about his behavior, he either aggressively denies it or threatens to kill himself. I can't forgive him for what he's done to our family, but I can't stand to see him like this any longer. My goal has been to graduate, move far away from home, and start over, but I don't want my mother to deal with this all on her own. We've considered looking into nursing homes, but his condition isn't quite bad enough to get him in one. Plus, money is tight which makes things more difficult. I'm just terrified that my father's going to end up hurting himself, my mom, or me. I know this was a long post and I'm not expecting anyone to read the whole thing, but I'm just very lost and scared of what the future will bring.",1
"Let me preface this by saying that my parents and grandma (80) are strict conservative Christians. Yes, this important info. They’re hispanic so they take it very seriously!

The other day, my mom was helping my grandma do some stretches/exercises. These exercises keep her active and gives her something to do where she isn’t sitting down for hours all hunched over working on her knitting. My grandma isn’t a fan of them because she prefers not to walk around or move too much during the day. My mom told her to put her arms up for the exercise, but my grandma was barely raising her hands. In turn, my mom took her arms and raised them up above her head.

My grandma proceeded to say, “Geez lady! Why do you want me to raise my arms so high?! You want me to grab Christ by his dick and balls?!” This was so out of character for my VERY conservative Christian grandma. The look of horror on my mom’s face while my grandma just giggled made me choke on my own spit. I couldn’t stop laughing for at least 5 mins. All the while, my mom was praying, asking God to forgive my grandma. 

I know this disease is draining for everyone involved, but moments like those make it a tiny bit less bad. Hope that was able to make you laugh! 

Happy holidays!",1
"My mother had had increasing paranoia over the last year leading her to be resistant to taking medication. It has been a couple of months since she has consistently had her medication as much as she should. In the last month he has become more aggressive towards staff who try to help her, hitting and scratching a couple of times. I had them test her for a UTI which in my opinion they should have known to do on their own. Found out a few days ago its positive so we don;t know how long hse had it. In the last few days she has lashed out verbally and threatened to hit another resident, that paired with actually hitting more staff yesterday they decided to call an ambulance and have her transported to the hospital. She was admitted for the UTI which they are treating with IV antibiotics. She is going to have an evaluation with a social worker and probably be transported to a geriatric psych facility. Its hard to say how much of this is due to the UTI and how much was underlying already. She has never been physically or verbally abusive to people in this way before but she was definitely unhappy and very resistant to care before. Shes never been aggressive with any family. This is all very stressful for us, her loved ones but also for her. I feel terrible this is happening to her but I'm not sure what I can really do to help her at this point. It's been a really long road trying to get her the best care and be there for her and I feel absolutely mentally and emotionally exhausted at this point. I am having a hard time focusing on being a good mother to my children and taking care of my family while having to deal with this. If you have been in this position with your loved one before please tell me any advice you can give. I want to make sure I am advocating for her but I cannot be there as I have small children at home. That paired with it being Christmas is making this very hard. If you have any advice or just support please let me know.",1
"This is a rant, I just need to vent somewhere. I am just so done with this whole disease and am angry about it.
So my grandparents live in a nursing home for the last 2 years. My grandpa has severe vascular dementia, but he is pretty verbal and has a lot of mobility. My grandmother is senile and mostly bedridden. She is very manipulative and wants everything to be about her and tries to keep everybody - me, my mom, the staff of the home and my grandpa - involved with her. She always needs stuff done for her, calls us a hundred times for a jacket she is unable to find, or if my mother could pick up some orange juice for her. 
My grandpa is always very confused about his situation and the ramblings and frustration my grandmother has does not help with his mental status and only gets him more agitated. 
Today he called my mom and threatened to jump out a window, accused her of putting him in a home even though he does not need to live there, and if he dies it’s her fault. 
This is already the second time he does this and last time he was put in a psych ward and given new medication. Now it happens again and I am just tired. It’s Christmas and this just hangs over our family now. I feel so sorry for my mom because she does a lot for my grandparents and they are just acting ungrateful. I know it’s the dementia but it’s still frustrating. 

Thanks for reading. Happy holidays.",1
"The paperwork was done yesterday. After a year of having her live with us she is being moved there. While she doesn't want to go. My dad and i believe it will be the best thing for her. I might miss her being around a little but now i won't feel like i have to rush back home at any moment when she doesn't want to go with meor when i went out with friends for a little bit (mostly only when dad was home especially after the first time she called her sister in law saying i left before 6 am and didn't say anything. I left at 10 am told her three different times that i was going to be gone and sat her out some soup for her to cook if she got hungry)

Dad and grandma having been arguing for the last month same thing different day. I put this on my dad since he is the one that doesn't let it slide when she says something or just gets tired of saying the same thing over and over again. But the stress it causes us all isn't good for any of us especially her. 

She has been trying to leave since the paperwork has been sign to go to her house which was sold last year before she moved in. Last night she tried to leave at midnight. Luckly dad was still up.  

Her claim that we don't care hurts so much. I spent this past year of my life being here for her, cooking for her, and helping with anything she needed did i do a good job probably not. But if i didn't care i would have left or not agreed to let her move in. 

Dad starts a better job tuesday so i guess everything falls into place. The job will have him gone for atleast 6 days at a time. 

This Christmas is going to suck. Arguing, her normally antics. 

The best part yesterday morning i sat on the couch 15ft from the wooden chair i have been using for past couple of weeks when hanging out with her in the living room means I hate her. Im sorry that the wooden chair is uncomfortable and I wanted some comfort. The wooden chair is closer to where she sits.

I wish everyone a merry Christmas and happy holidays

I needed to vent a little because the arguing about her going is really starting to get to me. The crying is starting to be annoying. The saying that we don't care is the worse part we tried our damnest to make her feel safe and to make her as happy as possible but nothing we did was good enough.  


To everyone that is/has given care to your love one. I wish you the best.",1
"My mom has recently got a MMSE score of 18/30, indicating she has mild/moderate dementia. The progression has been fast, and the system moves slowly. The referral for neurology is a little ways out for the official diagnosis, but we are are coming to terms with our new reality as a family. 

She reports having to urinate about every 20-25 minutes, but she often doesn’t produce very much urine. Even with drinking water regularly, this seems like a lot of bathroom trips, especially since her bladder isn’t full. She was treated with several medications over the past few months for overactive bladder syndrome with no real changes. She now has a referral for urology.

I am wondering if other people have had similar experiences or can offer some insights with dementia and the frequent and strong urge to urinate. It seems like this could be a fixation or OCD issue, as she fixated on other sensory things that most people would be able to manage: TV volume (has to be nearly silent), smells with cooking (windows have to be open, even when just cooking with the microwave), and extreme hot/cold sensitivity.

Are there any strategies or therapies that has helped manage the experience of these feelings? Any insights would be so helpful.",1
"I don’t really know where to start but having a combative/aggressive parent with Alzheimer’s is the worst. I am just trying to help get her cleaned up but get kicked and slapped like I am nothing. It’s so hard to want to do anything for her at this point or anymore while getting my a$$ beat. It mostly happens when I need to change her diaper or give her a bath. She’s kinda strong so I just hold her (if she’s hitting me) for a bit then try run away, yesterday she threw me on the ground. I got a prescription for seroquel for a very small dose 12.5mg which I’m to give her at night. I’m not sure it’s helping so I’ve upped it to the whole 25mg which kind of also doesn’t seem like enough? What else can I do besides medicate her?  When this stuff happens I wish I wasn’t ever born.",1

My grandma has recently started to be gentler to me (still extremely cruel to my mom though) and I was planning on trying to see her over the holidays. I miss her so much and feel like I need to take this opportunity to see her. My mom is very hurt by this and I don’t know what to do. 

-

My grandma has had worsening dementia for about 3 years now. My mom and I used to be super close with her - talked almost every day, saw each other all the time, etc. Over the last couple of years, my grandma has become more paranoid of us and completely shut us out - she even tried to get my mom arrested for paying off the doctor to diagnose her w dementia (obviously untrue). The last time I saw her in person, 2 years ago, she yelled at me on the front porch of her house and said I’m a traitor and she wants nothing to do with me for the rest of her life. 

It has been so beyond painful losing my grandma, she was truly my best friend and I think about her every day. I miss her so much literally all the time. I tried calling her many times but until recently she had no interest in speaking to me. 

But I called her on Thanksgiving, and it was the conversation I had basically dreamed of having for the last two years. She got emotional, said she loves me and misses me, that the last few years have been hard, and that if I’m ever in the area she would love to see me. She still thought my mom is evil but she said she didn’t want to keep pushing me away bc of what my mom has done to her. I called her again last week to see if it was a one-off but she was nice again and still wants to see me. I am planning on driving up to see her for lunch one day over the holidays. I know it might not go well but I want to take the chance.

My parents live about 3-4 hours away from her now. I am staying with them for the holidays. When I told my mom originally i wanted to see my grandma, she was really happy for me. Now as time has passed, she is really upset with me, really angry, and clearly hurt. 

I cannot imagine how my mom must feel after everything she has been through. I understand that deep down, she is hurt and probably envious that my grandma is easing up on me but not her.

But things have been really difficult. My mom is constantly reminding me of the horrible things my grandma has said about me, sharing voicemails of my grandma saying she wants nothing to do with me, etc. I’m aware of all of this, my grandma has said all this to my face, I’m not going into this blind or with false expectations. But it’s just been really painful. It’s been nonstop since I landed at the airport, literally before I even got my luggage. I know she’s trying to protect me but it’s just causing hurt and stress. 

I don’t know what to do. 

I want to see my grandma even though I know there is a high chance she may have a bad day, feel paranoid/hateful, and not want to see me after I drive up. But even if that happens, I think it would be worse to NOT go and know I missed my one opportunity to see/hug my grandma again. Right?

Has anyone been in a similar position or have any insight? I’m lost and would appreciate any advice",1
"my friend has been really really struggling with their situation because their mother has dementia and their sister apparently parked the car in the wrong spot at her apartment complex and it was towed. my friends sister is being absolutely no help and refuses to take any responsibility and keeps asking my friend to just ""fix it"" what are the next steps to take to figure out where the car is? my friend has no information on it besides it's make and model but since their mother has dementia she's certain she can't authorize anything. i've never been in this situation either since i've never had a car so i'm reaching out so maybe i can get some advice. thank you. if you need more details to help please comment.",1
"He's a first generation immigrant, i never ever heard him gossip or talk about something that's not his business, on the contrary, he'll make it clear that it doesnt concern him and dont want to talk about it.

However, since he's had dementia he has absolutely no filter ! I am kind of a caregiver for him and my grandma, so we spend a fair amount of time together and he'll speak of things that happened years ago that we didnt even think he was aware of ! 

On the bright side, He's not being mean and it's always the thruth, but whenever there is a sensitive subject he'll jump right in to give a piece of his mind and i know some family members find it funny until he talks about them and they get kind of mad

Some exemples : my uncle is kind of a doormat to his wife , last time my grandfather told us laughing "" yeah, he's afraid of his wife"" within earshot and my uncle quickly left

One of my cousin and his wife always come at donner time without calling first, my grand parents eat very early ( 6pm max ) but they come at 8 and my grand mother has to go cook and serve them, my grand father said "" they always come at dinner time because they dont want to cook, so they make her get up, serve them, wait for them to leave to wash the dishes so when they get back home they just have to relax in front of the TV"" and they heard him as well

I don't know if it's because he's getting older and have nothing to lose or if it is because of dementia 

Anyone has any advice ? I'm not sure what to do or say in these situations, most of the time he knows not to say it directly to their face but he often talks within earshot so they hear it all the same",1
"TA because I am a bit embarrassed about this situation. Sorry if this is long, I’m just trying to be thorough. My 28F grandfather has been diagnosed with dementia since 2015. It was early stages until late October where it went from stage 2 to stage 6 in the span of 7 days. It was like a switch flipped, he got sick and suddenly he didn’t know who any of us were. He presented classic stroke symptoms, so we took him to the ER where they explained he had a cold, dehydration and mild malnutrition. I began stopping by my grandpas during the day for the entirety of November. At some point, he became an elopement risk in his home and because I work graveyards, I became my grandfather’s caretaker from 3AM - 3PM. His new wife [60F] has him from 3PM - 3AM. 


His disease progressed to Stage 7, he has expressed hypersexual tendencies (such as looking at porn all day - per his wife.) I didn’t think anything of this because I (unfortunately) had to clear out the computer he used when my grandma was alive and it sort of aligned with this “new” attitude his wife was stating, however, those sexual advances were always aimed at his new wife. For the past few days, he has declined significantly more again. This could be deduced to accidental mishaps, but I am on high alert 24/7/365 due to childhood trauma so I don’t want to minimize the situation at hand. He stares at me for hours at a time, has tried to grab my breasts and has tried kissing me and if I’m being frank, it’s becoming incredibly uncomfortable being around him. There are other situations but a lot of this has led to a lot of agitation on his end as well. Enough that the doctor thought he may be “sun-downing.” I have researched a lot into dementia and how to best care for him, but I am stuck in a limbo with him right now as to how I can best set boundaries and ensure my safety while around my grandfather.


Since I feel this may come up: while I would push the entirety of care onto his wife, she does have an active APS case against her for a multitude of reasons and cannot be trusted with his daily medical care. Plus, I’m worried about him given he was suffering from malnutrition and dehydration when we got to him in late October. With me, I ensure he eats, sleeps and drinks fluids. He is not an elopement risk while with me, however his wife states he is one, so I’d rather be safe than sorry. We cannot afford a nursing home. We tried for Medicaid, and I was told he would be denied because his wife makes too much (+SSI) so a waiver is out of the question at this point and time. As far as other caretakers available, there are none. His wife will not let anyone step to help outside of the hours of 3AM – 3PM and as such no one else can step in to help. His new wife also is at odds with almost all of my family. To quote her “The vibes are off.” This is not normal behavior for him either. He is former sex crimes police officer and thus, despises any form of sexual harassment or assault. I’m having difficulty dealing with this sudden change in personality and just need advice. Does anyone have any?",1
"I just lost my first grandparent last week. Really, I lost her months ago to Dementia and thought I came to terms with it, but she finally came to the end. I am one of the oldest grandchildren and had all my grandparents still, until that moment. We all knew she was at the end and had hospice for her for the last week of her journey. The grief comes in waves. Mostly, the hard feelings are coming from knowing that my grandpa lost his love of over 60 years. Part of me knows that he is better, not having to be her constant care taker, but it still hurts. Small things make it easier, I got 34 years, my kids were able to know her and love her, she was surrounded by loved ones. But, it still hurts.",1
"Hi....warning....long long rant. So my dad has recently went into nursing home in Scotland, we chose very carefully and in the end this was the only 1 we found to be clean, friendly, homely, lots of staff, extremely attentive to residents etc. Excellent care commission reports. He has vascular dementia and other health issues and has catheter.
I've been visiting him weekly since he moved in 6 weeks ago and 1 st 2 visits, he was soaking with urine it was very obvious and when I pointed it out to staff they questioned it when it's blatantly obvious his trousers and slippers were darker in places=wet and had to go ask for sheet to change bed. So I'm frustrated not only is he wet but also indicates an issue with catheter, not only day leg bags but also nite bag if bed is wet. Plus his morning pills were still sitting and I arrived at noon. I asked nurse if he was now on afternoon meds and she said no so I suggested in future he should be monitored as he'll forget to take them. Inside I'm screaming this is a dementia unit, surely it's necessary to ensure residents take meds when needed on time supervised especially considering they're in there with cognitive decline.
Every time I've visited his room hasn't been cleaned for the day. They say they'll be in soon.
Following 2 visits I noticed his skin on his legs is starting to break down so asked for him to be prescribed barrier cream, again I feel frustrated this hadn't been noted during personal hygiene or dressing routines.
Today I went to visit and took my daughter and granddaughter to see g'dad for Xmas. I found him asleep in chair in room with dirty nappy on floor, excrement over bathroom and on his hands, he had a plate beside him so I'm assuming he's ate with shit on his hands. I spoke to nurse, normally I'd just deal with it myself but wanted to give him privacy as had younger family with me. Later I asked how his teeth are and in him showing me, he had such a build up of plaque, he let me brush them and it caused his gums to bleed again I feel his dental hygiene isn't being addressed. He still has most of his teeth where I suppose many residents may have false teeth but still...uuurgh.
I appreciate the staff have many residents to deal with and my dad will not ask them for any help and I appreciate its a nursing home so I think maybe the emphasis is on medical stuff rather than personal hygiene but also know that if personal hygiene is neglected it becomes a medical issue. I wanted to explode at them today with frustration. Thanks if you made it this far for listening. I'm just sad the care and attention we gave to my dad is slipping. I've spoke to staff, I don't know what more I can do.",1
"This is gonna be a long post, but I do need some kind of advice. Not sure even who to ask or what to do, so I came here.

I'm not sure, but I think my dad has a form of dementia. For years, he struggled with narcotic addictions, and although he is still on them right now, it's being managed by my mother.

He is 64 years old. His addiction started when he was in his early 40's and was brought mostly under control when he was in his early 50's. Even saying this, I'm not entirely sure there wasn't abuse going on earlier than that.

Anyway, so for the past decade or so, he's been pretty forgetful. It was just mild stuff, like losing his keys, wallet, not remembering where stuff was. Just here and there, nothing abnormal. But earlier this year, he suffered a heart attack (He's had them before, this was the 4th or 5th one he's had.) and died in the ambulance. He was dead for 3-5 minutes. He had surgery to put in a defibrillator a couple of weeks later after a scare.

But ever since he died, these memory issues have gotten much worse. He was already an insomniac, but it's gotten so bad. Especially in the afternoon through the night. He's become belligerent, easily agitated--and he's having episodes of doing things that he has no memory of the next morning.

(For example, he grabbed a pot of potatoes my mom never ended up cooking and I guess he was going to make himself mashed potatoes? I'm not really sure. But he put them on to boil and then forgot about them. I woke up to them burning and took them off. We can only assume he did it because no one else could've. He didn't remember doing it at all. He also kept my mom up half the night explaining to her that she needed to learn Morse code. Being kind of angry about it, for some reason.)

It's reached the point of him asking what day it is at least 5 times in an hour. His primary care doctor's son was recently murdered so he hasn't been taking appointments. But My mom is working on getting my dad a doctor appointment ASAP anyway. We suspected parasomnia, but it could be sundown syndrome, too... Won't know for sure until he's seen by a doctor.

I just don't know what we're gonna do if it gets any worse. I'm disabled myself and not really able to assist him if something happens, everyone else in the house works... but he's always been against going to a nursing home. At this point though I think he'd need the supervision and realistically, none of us are equipped to supply round the clock care. I'm afraid of him burning the house down or injuring himself. This is by far the scariest thing I've ever had to deal with. I'm really out of my element with this one and I don't know what I'm going to do.",1
"My husband, with moderate dementia from Parkinson's, is in a short-term rehab nursing home (up to 100 days) after hospitalization of 3 weeks for kidney infection. He has been in this nursing home for almost 2 weeks. No big problems until last night. They recently moved his room, and an aide on evening shift who had been off for a week came back to work and had him for the first time. I visit every evening for 2 to 4 hours. Last evening, I arrived at 6:15 pm, and he was in gown, and in bed for sleeping (not sitting up to watch TV), which has never been the case here; he usually is up reading or watching TV, or talking with me, and doesn't usually get in bed until about 8:30 to 9:00. So I asked why he was in bed so early, and he told me he was being ""punished"" and that the aide made him get in bed because he had gotten in trouble for emptying his nephrostomy bags. So I told him, well, the aides like to do that themselves, and that he should leave that to them in the future. But he was so nervous and scared, and said she had also turned off the lights (around 6:00 pm) but that when the nurse came in, he asked her to turn the lights back on, which she did.

So, anyway, I went out to ask the aide if she had been having any difficulty with him, and to ask why he was put in bed so early and she immediately became very defensive, and proceeded to tell me that the entire hall of about 20 patients was put in bed to sleep about 6 pm (which I thought was a little strange) and then she sarcastically - and in a very hostile tone - asked if she should not get him ready for bed, and would I do it when I visit? (Of course I could, or would if necessary, but that's not the point!).

Later he was afraid to drink some water she brought because maybe she poisoned it. I said No, it's OK, but he clearly was afraid of this aide, and throughout his many hospitalizations over the years, and in this setting for the previous week, he has never been afraid of an aide.

So, my son urged me to talk to an administrator, so I called and talked to the nursing unit manager, firstly to ask if it was customary to tell patients that they need to go to sleep at 6 pm, and to let her know he was frightened by this aide.

Well, this triggered a Risk Assessment, because, she said, I used the word ""afraid"" and she was required to escalate that to Risk Department or something. I tried talking with her more about it, but all she did was defend the aide as someone who is one of the best and has worked there for years (turns out she was talking about a different aide than the one who took care of him), and regarding bedtime, every patient has a right to choose their bedtime. He definitely was given no choice, and was too intimidated to ask to stay up longer.

But this is ridiculous- I don't want an Abuse Assessment, which is what they are calling it, I think it is, at most, an issue of patient rights, but there was probably some kind of psychological intimidation happening, which should be addressed with this aide, but I am most afraid that they will kick him out or discharge him early because they perceive all this as a ""complaint"" of abuse! I need him to stay in there for the next month while I am busy getting contractors to modify a bathroom for him, get a hospital bed put together, and hire some help (which I have not needed over the last 5 years until now), so I can bring him home.

And, I am scared of retaliation. Word has already spread all over this facility, and this event to me is not such a big deal, although I would like this aide to have a little reeducation or counseling, perhaps. Frankly, her bizarre hostility and defensiveness towards me, upon first meeting me, did make me wonder how she had treated him. And the Unit Manager's behavior was also very cold and condescending which is not like my interactions with other people at this nursing home. And I am a bit offended by this Head Nurse - I have 40 years experience as an RN, and was an aide for 2 years, and have worked in nursing homes, and also was a college professor, so I was privately offended by being treated like an idiot by this nurse. 

But apparently, there is no way I can stop this Abuse Investigation, even though I was not claiming there was abuse, and was not even making a formal complaint, but just wanted to know what the situation was about bedtime, and wanted a nurse to know that this aide had made him afraid. 

Any thoughts? 

I am a nervous wreck and am about to take a short trip (for a week, but with me traveling back for Christmas Day in the middle of the trip to see him, then back - first time away in 5 years of caretaking!), and was hoping all would be well in the nursing home. What a mess! 

I suppose we are all supposed to keep quiet and not advocate for our loved ones ...

I will post this also on the caretaker sub.",1
Thank you to everyone who has commented on any of my posts. Grandad passed away this morning at home with his family by his side.,1
"Hi, I’m not even really sure why I’m writing this aside from to get my thoughts down, I guess. 

My dad (78) was diagnosed with Lewy Body last summer and it’s been a rapid decline ever since. 

He got the diagnosis as I (31) moved across the world to fulfil a dream years in the making of living in Canada. And he’s gotten bad quickly. My mother, uncle, brother and sister have been around to care for him throughout. I saw him last Christmas and he had degenerated to toddler stage, still talking but only a few words and mainly tapping his feet and hands and trying to follow conversations. 

I haven’t been able to come back to see him again until this Christmas, and today he was discharged from a 3 week hospital visit after catching covid and developing a chest infection. 

He’s completely non-verbal, and doesn’t even really walk anymore. My mum was spoon feeding him before hospital, but his throat atrophied and now he’s on a feeding tube. 

He’s just so small and frail, and he constantly looks terrified. It’s unimaginable that my great big lion of a father has been reduced to this. He has full time care at home now with two nurses, but I find it so difficult to spend time with him because I just hold his hand and cry, which I can’t imagine is much fun for him. And he just looks at me with those scared eyes that are maybe searching for answers or help, or are blank - it’s so hard to tell. 

My family are talking about what happens next time he gets sick and whether we should send him back into hospital or “make him as comfortable as possible”. It doesn’t feel right to be making those decisions for someone else’s life, but I realise we’re also the only ones who can. 

I feel so much guilt for not having been here throughout his decline. It feels like I’ve run away and left everyone else to deal with it (even though they have tried to reassure me that’s not the case). I feel so much sadness when I look at him, which is then compounded by more guilt because how dare I feel sorry for him. I feel like I’ve done everything wrong and I’ve let him down. And I feel like I can’t make that decision about next steps but knowing the stage he’s at what needs to happen. 

If anyone has been through anything similar and you have any advice or words of wisdom, I’d love to hear them. What a fucking ugly disease, really.",1
"As the title says I’m (19) an at home carer for my grandma who has dementia. She moved in with my mother (her daughter in law) and I over a year ago and at the start it was okay, never without it’s challenges bus it was manageable. 

However these past few weeks she hasn’t been sleeping through the night. My mother works nightshift so that I can go to college throughout the day, (I go three days out of the week). However since my mother comes home from work she sleeps which technically speaking means I do nightshift and day shift with my grandma and lately it’s taken it’s toll. I’ve been showing up to college late from lack of sleep and sometimes even falling asleep in class (I’m an art student) but I’m so grateful that my lecturer understands how hard it can be. He lets me sleep and doesn’t mind me being late as long as I get a decent amount of the work done which I usually do. 

I’ve had 3 breakdowns in the past 2 weeks and tonight was the worst one yet. I can’t handle it anymore and I just want it all to be over. I feel disgusting because the only way for it to be over is for her to be gone.

Might be best if I mention that I have 2 older sisters (30 and 31) that don’t bother to help out with taking care of her at all and that my father passed away when I was young with his brother living in Australia therefore the only people who care enough to physically help my grandma is myself and my mother. My uncle checks in often but obviously can’t do much from half way across the world.

I’m sick of explaining my situation to people and about how much it’s affecting me as they all say the same things, “it’s not fair on you and your mother”, “maybe you should put her in a care home”, “I wouldn’t be able to handle that if I were you”. Like wow, thank you as if I didn’t know these things. A care home isn’t an option as she begged us before she was diagnosed to never put her in one so we are honouring that but my god is it hard…

I want to move out as my home has started feeling like just a house lately and I never look forward to coming back as I’m automatically put into work mode. But if I move out then it’s selfish to my mother and she raised me better than that. 

I’m really struggling and don’t know what to do.


EDIT: Uhm hi everyone, just wanted to update that she’s just been taken to hospital after she fell down the stairs. She was becoming delirious without sleep and I had sadly fallen asleep and woke up to her screaming. She may have a broken wrist and nose but her head was perfectly fine. Thank you all for your messages and advice but would like to say that we have tried absolutely everything to make things easier and none of them have panned out. Thanks again",1
"My grandpa has not been diagnosed with anything but has a history of dementia since his mom had it. He’s in the hospital right now with a neck fracture from a fall he took. He thinks he is 20 years old and back at the fire house. Today he thought he was in the Bronx but he hasn’t been there since he was young. Whenever the nurses told him where he was he would get mad and annoyed, he also constantly tries to tear off his neck brace he’s supposed to keep on 24/7. They do have him on morphine and he is sedated because of how aggressive he has been. Is it just because of the trauma of the neck injury and the sedation or is it early signs of dementia?",1
"Hiya Reddit,

I've come here seeking advice because at this point, I don't really know where else to turn to. I have always been a private person, so I never truly wished to consult or had the inclination to seek out help from others, but I'm not sure how to solve this crisis as it seems entirely out of my league. I'm sorry if it seems a bit ridiculous, but like I said, I've always been solitary.

I'm in my early teens and I currently live with my father and grandmother. My dad has been going through something extremely scary, to the point that I no longer feel that he's the same person that he was two years ago at all. I think it's some form of schizophrenia or dementia. Whatever it is, it's really bad. At some point in 2021, he started thinking that he was being gangstalked and spied on by federal agencies. This led to an increase in general belligerence towards other people during social interactions, and eventually got him and me kicked out of the apartment complex we resided at, since his aggression rose to the point that he started screaming nonsense and accusations at random people in the area. I tried desperately to try and convince him that none of what was happening to him was actually real and that everything was fine, but he always ended up yelling at me, so I just kept getting more discouraged and apathetic. 

Eventually, his antics worsened to a point that he threatened someone outside his residence by carrying around a shotgun and pointing it at them, resulting in him being arrested and jailed. This led to me being separated from him, along with my mother now taking protective custody of me. I lived with my mother for a few months, but her new husband didn't approve of the decision overall, so she and him somehow had custody of me delegated to my grandma. I'm not really sure how it happened, I'm just 14. But the thing about that is that my grandmother bailed my father out of jail, so now, I have to go back living with him, since he had no place to go as well.

It's been about a month since then. Whatever happened to him in jail didn't do anything to fix him at all, and it just seems like he's gotten worse. He's screaming incoherently at people on the streets of my grandma's neighborhood, randomly pointing at planes and helicopters and proclaiming that they're his, and that they all belong and answer to him. He constantly yells and acts abusive at my grandma and the only reason I suspect she puts up with it is because half of her mind is gone too, but at least she's still more cognizant than him. I tried to call my local Adult Mental Health Services facility, and they sent in some people to detain him on a 51-50 hold. He was held at the ER for a weekend and then they just randomly let him go, with my grandma having to drive him back. When I reviewed the medical documentation, they just labeled him as ""manic"". I attempted to get him on medication after making him see a doctor, risperidone in particular, but he vehemently refuses to take it and is completely unwilling to see a doctor from this point onwards. He plays loud music in our garage (with the garage door open, so everyone in the neighborhood can hear it), harasses grandma for money to buy cigarettes (His only source of income is SSDI payments), and just lazes about doing nothing but chase our neighbors, scream at the air, and talk about conspiracy theories. My grandma tries to ignore him most of the time, but every so often she gets upset and yells at him and they scream at each other for a while. I initially got angry at him as well in the first few days, but eventually I just decided that the screaming matches weren't worth the effort.

I'm at a standstill. I feel as if I don't have enough of ""worldly"" experience to make a decision on what to do here. I think his overall presence in this house is an enormous detriment to me and my Grandma, especially at her advanced age. I think he'll eventually drive me insane, and I keep questioning as to why I'm putting up with this. But that's the thing, I really don't know what to do here. Should I try to have him admitted to the ER as a 51-50 again, or should I try calling the police once I snap and finally have had enough? I think he has an outstanding felonious bench warrant to appear in court for mental competency due to his incident, but that's in a different state. 

Sorry about my messy stream of consciousness style of writing and my naivety in general. I've never actually put to text any of my experiences with my father the past year, and this whole thing just feels so surreal. I just turned 14 a couple months ago. I wish I had people to help me through it all, but my overall family is so tiny and disconnected, and during this whole thing I haven't been able to go to school.",1
"Mother in law lives with estranged husband. 
He’s also recently been diagnosed with dementia. 
Up until recently when she had delirium with a UTI , she has been steadily declining in health, refusing all help and sending people away, saying she’s fine.

After hospitalisation, a subsequent geriatric team have recommended she needs 24 hr care, asap. 
Poor hygiene, malnutrition, fall hazards etc.
(She already fell in her first day out of hospital back at home. )
We’ve been lucky to have found a facility close by that is a not for profit, who can take her in a few days time. 
Although she’s not cognitive enough to make complex decisions she’s been vehemently opposed to the idea of leaving her rental home. I’m dreading having to get her from her home to the residential care. There was fireworks last time we tried to discuss this and she screamed at us to leave. 
Her husband doesn’t seem to grasp her situation well and thinks she’s fine to stay at home. 
Drs suggested we ‘take her out for the day’ to have a ‘look’ at a “respite centre”. I just can’t imagine a way that this is going to go well, and how do we leave her there? 
We can’t collect any belongings, but may have to purchase basics so this can go into play.
We can tell her that our plan is  still to bring her to our house for Christmas and overnight till Boxing Day. 
She still needs to go back to the residential care though. 
She’s going to be so angry.
I’m feeling sick about it, any advice at all is appreciated.",1
"Mom goes to an Adult Day Program twice a week - the HandiDart (bus) service picks her up and drops her back home.    But she gets it in her head sometimes that they're coming to pick her up to go to the lodge and it's almost impossible to dissuade her of that fact.    After going to the lodge this morning, she spent a couple of hours in the late afternoon in her coat and scarf staring out the window waiting for the bus again even though I told her repeatedly she'd already been.    She doesn't believe me when I tell her - she thinks I'm misinformed and wants to be ""ready"".    I've even had to resort to calling the Program and having them talk to her.

The worst part is that if I'm not around, she starts heading outside to wait for the bus.    I had hired a woman staying with her for three hours on the one day I have to work in the office.    I came home to have my neighbour tell me my mother wasn't home - she'd convinced the neighbours that she had to be at the Program and the bus was late so they offered to drive her there.

So I got the woman to stay with her for pretty much the entire time I am at work.    But she was leaving just before I got home and in that short space of time mom got her coat on and was walking out the door as I pulled into the driveway.    Now I have arranged for the woman to stay till I get home.   But I'm really worried.    What if she goes wandering when I'm out getting groceries or running other errands?",1
"I’m thinking about getting a realistic baby doll for my mom, but I’m worried it will somehow go wrong. I always worry that she’s going to think I’m patronizing her or she’ll be offended by something like this. Has anyone ever had something like this go poorly? Stories of success?",1
"A couple months ago my adoptive dad was diagnosed with moderate to severe vascular dementia, now it’s more severe. Stage 6 out of 7 so I had to make a difficult decision with winter coming and moved him into a really nice memory care facility with private aids and so far it’s been an utter and complete nightmare. He hates it, doesn’t trust anyone, hasn’t slept more than an hour or two in days. He’s violent, mean, and semi mobile. Home wasn’t sustainable anymore though, he would light fires in the fire place and logs would tumble out, he was falling a lot and his house is all hard wood and stone. He had 3 strokes this year and the falls with blood thinners can cause internal bleeding. 

I’m feeling so overwhelmed and frustrated and I just need some words of encouragement and support. Any tips too. I live 4 hours away but my work schedule in the new year allows me to travel to him more but right now with the lack of sleep he’s all of the place and feeling so depressed.",1
"My wife, daughter and I live in a split house. Her grand parents live in the back apartment. Her grand father was diagnosed a few years ago with dementia. Over the past year or so, things have really progressed.. It’s at a point where he doesn’t even remember who his wife is, wears a brief and can’t exactly fend for himself. 
He often knocks on our door/peers through our windows late at night. Well as of recently it’s gotten to a point where we can’t even leave our door unlocked in fear that he’ll just walk into our house and starts shouting “hello” (has happened a few times while Im trying to put my daughter to bed/I’m in the shower) 

The worst of it is the wandering.. 
At least once a week one of the neighbours will have to walk him back over to his house saying that he was either trying to walk into their house/had successfully welcomed himself into their home.. (asking for a “ride home”/asking where his wife and daughters are)

Well, it’s now mid December and for the second time this week I have been sent to roam the neighbourhood in search of her grandfather because he’s “gotten out again” 

I don’t mind helping how ever I can. But none of the family members (including his own wife) seem to care enough to take action.
They constantly just brush it off and down play the whole situation..

This poor man needs help. 
Help that his wife and family clearly cannot and will not provide.
It breaks my heart to see him wandering about with no jacket on not knowing where he is/where he lives..

I don’t know what to do. He needs professional help, but they refuse to put him in full time care (money is not the issue, just stubbornness)


Any advice would be very much appreciated.


Thank you",1
"I’ve noticed my mom is starting to steal from stores (mostly lotions/face creams). She has no need to steak since she has so many lotions at home. 

I haven’t caught her red handed but I’ve seen the merchandise in her purse or she has accidentally left it in my car. When I ask her about it, she gets pissed I accuse her of shoplifting, we get into an argument, and then our outing is over. 

For instance we just left a big box store and my mom’s little purse looked fuller compared to when we walked in. When we left the store, I asked her why she opened the box of facial cream while we were in line. She claimed she wanted to see the bottle. I told her I knew she stole something from the store. She opened her purse to show she didn’t steal but refused to allow me to look inside. I didn’t go to other stores and dropped her off. 

I will get her a small purse that will only fit her her wallet and phone but I have a feeling she won’t use it. I don’t want not bring her with me since I’m the only person who takes her out. Another suggestion is that I follow her every step and not shop for myself? 

Mind you, she steals stuff she doesn’t need…so it’s not a necessity. 

I feel really guilty.  She wasn’t a shoplifter before. Her dementia (short term memory) has  progressed. 

Suggestions? Thank you in advance",1
"I'm just wondering what have you seen that works best for a person with dementia who literally won't go to sleep and won't stop talking nonstop?  My dad will stay up for multiple days straight with no sleep, constantly moving around (walking, moving things) and also talking nonstop.    

Any medications and/or other methods that you've seen work?  Meds advice would be most appreciated bc my dad hasn't tried meds yet to treat all these dementia symptoms and nothing we try non-medication ways seem to do anything to decrease these behaviors.  I'm not going to take anything you say as medical advice, but it will help when I talk to his health care providers.  Thank you for any info!",1
"Hi Ik that my post is probably not gonna be read but I just need to vent about my gran 

She was diagnosed with vascular dementia earlier this year and ever since then it’s been a downward spiral that is just getting worse by the day 

Now for context I’m only 18 and she was diagnosed when I was 17 ever since her diagnosis my mental health has been on a downward spiral mainly because I bottle everything up and pretended that everything was fine and we would get through this however with issues that are outside of the whole dementia thing I have been unable to bottle stuff up anymore and at the slightest inconvenience I will think about bad things (I’ll never turn to them ) but that’s besides the point tonight I was out with friends having fun we realized that it was almost 12 am so we decided to head home I’m currently crashing on a friends couch who stays across from my gran who’s lights where on in her house when I went into see what was happening I found that she was still awake at half one in the morning and had decided to rearrange the house so when I went in i seen all the stuff she had moved and it looked as though she had been robbed and she was just sat in the kitchen eating biscuits and it has just upset me a lot to see her like that 

Thanks for reading this sorry for shit grammar I’m just trying to vent

"If you have any tips for helping with sundowning they would be much appreciated? 

My grandmother sundowns every night it gets emotionally exhausting trying to get her to calm down or try to figure out whats bothering her. 

I try to reassure her everything is okay. I tried to make her understand that we care and love her. That we are their for her.

 Nothing i do seems to calm her down for more then a few minutes. I get her to a state where we can joke around a little or her telling stories of her past.

But not even five minutes after i try to go too bed if its late or return to what ever i was doing after sitting with her for a 20 to 30 minutes it starts right back up. 

So any tips are appreciated.",1
"Well, true to form, my latest visit to see my mum in a care facility ended with tears.

I only lasted 15 minutes, after she got stuck in the ""why am I here?"" rut. This time she told me ""there's nothing wrong with me"", ""I can cook"", and ""my family have put me in here"".

I tried, I really did. Love lies, one after another. ""You'll see the doctor later and he can let you go home"", ""your house is being renovated"", and ""you're just in here for a short break"". Alas, she just got more and more distressed.

I really don't know when I'll visit again. It can't be good for her, and I have to emotionally decompress.",1
"Mom is 59. Has been dealing with forgetfulness for 3-4 years which has rapidly progressed over last few months. Yesterday she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s.

I’m shocked and think I have been in denial to this when now it seems obvious. I want to take action but have no idea what?

Can you all kindly share resources, stories, how to prepare, what I can expect, what I should do?

"My mum who is in her early 50s keeps leaving the house for appointments that don’t exist.  A couple of days ago , she left the house  at 11pm for an appointment that was the next day . For example yesterday  she received a text message from her doctors reminding her that she’s got an appointment on Monday but because she received the text at 2pm, she got ready to leave the house saying her appointment was at 2pm . I have tried explaining to her that 2pm  was the time she received the text but she wouldn’t believe me and was adamant in leaving house. I am extremely worried and not sure what to do.",1
"My loved one has not been diagnosed with dementia, and I'm not sure if they have it, or if something else is wrong.

They recently had a UTI which became a blood infection due to not being treated.  It could have killed them.  They consistently do not remember what their medical emergency was caused by, and seem to not treat it seriously when I explain it to them.  

Shortly after, they had a mouse infestation, which they did not address swiftly or effectively and the infestation went uncontrolled for a couple months until the house was overrun.  They finally engaged an exterminator and got rid of the mice, but they haven't taken appropriate or timely action to clean up the waste and other evidence left in the house.  They do not take it seriously when myself and others say they do not want to visit the house, or eat meals prepared in the house, or whatever, until cleaning is done.  They try to laugh it off.  

Is it a possible sign of some kind of dementia to lose the capacity to take serious situations seriously?  If so, what kind of dementia is it associated with?  They have been more on the hypervigilant side in the past - this is a pretty significant change in attitude.

Thanks for any advice/info.",1
"My grandmother will most likely be in a nursing home before the summer.  

She's somewhere in mid-stage dementia, honestly her symptoms are a mix so it's hard to say.  

We're at the point where she needs to go soon, for her sake and especially my grandfather's.  

They're both 90 years old.  

She still has around 2-3 really good day per week.  She will be up early, showered, dressed, and going about her business.  She will do housework, she will go up and down the basement stairs doing laundry, she will make lunch, she will cook a nice dinner.  

Better than most 90 year olds who DON'T have dementia, if you ask me.  

But other days she is half out of it.  In her pajamas all day, confused, not knowing where she lives, laying on the couch all day.  


The MAIN problem though is sundowning.  She is AWFUL at night.  Even on her good day, she never has any good nights anymore.  Sometimes a good day will continue later than others, past dinner and until around midnight.  But that's when she *always* starts to lose it.  

She will believe my grandfather is her dad. She will refuse to go to bed.  She will tell my grandfather (as her dad) to go home and get out of her house.  She will ask him where her husband is.  She will threaten him, she will throw things, she will push him.  She will put some clothes into a bag and leave the house in the middle of the night (this started over the summer, and she would only walk around the block then come home, but now it's getting dangerous with winter temperatures).  

Some days my grandfather is only getting two-three hours of sleep because of her, and he's fucking 90 with heart issues.  

Basically we're entering the point of no return, she needs to go into a nursing home and soon.  


How do you do that though when she's still having so many good days?  She doesn't recognize (or refuses to accept) that there's anything wrong with her.  

I hate to see how sad, hurt, miserable, etc. she's going to be once we put her in a home.  

I almost wish that she would decline more very suddenly and *stop* having those good days.  

I mean, last week this woman cooked a pot roast dinner, decorated her Christmas tree, called me up to come over to eat, was dressed nicely and had makeup on (that she was able to do by herself).....

I know she has to go into a nursing home because of her bad days and her daily nighttime behavior, but at the same time it doesn't ""feel"" right.  

Also, we've tried multiple medications to keep her calm, they haven't worked well.  We've talked to multiple home nursing agencies (my grandfather can afford it) about overnight care but they've all said it would be a waste of time since they are mandated reporters and she would be put away regardless once they saw her threatening or pushing my grandfather for elder abuse.",1
"I just wanted to make a post about this. My grandma passed away not long after I made that post about three weeks ago. She was very strong, too strong. Hospice was such a huge huge help in providing 24/7 care and ensuring that she will be able to pass away peacefully, which she did. She died feeling no pain surrounded by her closest family. I miss her so much. I miss her more every day. Her memorial was earlier this week. We shared many laughs and made it a celebration of her life like she wanted. She is loved by everyone she met.

In context of my uncle who had a stroke, he is paralyzed on his left side. He is doing in patient therapy and is already walking some. He's making great progress and his physical therapist is happy with how fast the progress is.

Thank you to everyone who helped me when I made posts and responded to any questions I had.",1
"My mom has frontal-temporal dementia, is fairly young, has trouble communicating, and is in long-term care. She has been refusing food and not swallowing her medication. She has lost a significant amount of weight over the last 1.5 months. The care staff have had trouble getting samples, and are not keen on using more interventions (e.g., restraint) to do this so that we can find out what is going on.

"My dad has moderate stage mixed dementia.  

He also has advanced spinal stenosis and an enlarged prostate which he was taking meds for that made him dizzy but chose to no longer take them.  Triple whammy.  

For the last month, we have tried everything from Trazadone, to Oxazepam to melatonin and the Trazadone barely worked, and the Melatonin barely worked.  

We just started him on 15mg of Oxazepam last night and he slept for 7.5 hours.  Hallelujah!!!

But the dizziness.  The agitation.  The anxiety.  

He has complained of dizziness even when he wasn't experiencing insomnia.  

But now these meds are making his dizziness worse, and also since it's been a month since he's got more than 3 hours sleep a night, it has made him decline even more.  

So tonight, I'm gonna try him on half a pill.  

He just panics so much over the dizziness.

Today, he said he wanted to jump off the balcony and end things since he couldn't handle it anymore.  

I told him just to sit back and relax and it will subside.

Nope.  

He's had tests done to find out the cause, and it's nothing physiologically wrong.   Except his specialist says, the dementia could also be causing his dizziness.  

I feel so helpless.   I just want his dizziness to stop :(",1
"My grandmother (late 70s) has developed vascular dementia. I personally diagnosed her two months ago. The hospital just diagnosed her last week. The issue is my grandfather won’t admit to the hospital what she’s doing. Which is why it has taken so long to get a diagnosis.
She’s having wild delusions. The hospital isn’t being much help. The won’t commit her even tho the cops have been called to their house over 30 times in the past month and a half. They’ve placed her on three separate police mandated 72 hour holds and have tried each time to send her home early and even threatened to charge my grandfather with elderly abuse if he didn’t come pick her up.

"None of my friends have had grandparents with dementia, well one of my friends does but she has a bad relationship w/ her grandparent and is not very involved.

I just don’t want to talk to them because I’m not sure what to say right now.

This whole time as his dementia progressed I haven’t thought about what he was like before dementia and now I’m having intrusive thoughts about it, making the situation even more difficult. I was close with him and I feel like I’m reacting really weird. 

I don’t necessarily need to be comforted, I’m not a wreck. I posted a few days ago that I felt numb and I still feel that way but right now my body is like having involuntary anxiety responses (trembling, cold sweat, tears even when I’m not feeling anything). I’ve actually been randomly laughing with no thoughts in my head and it’s a little scary… can’t explain that one. 

I guess I need advice, anyone who has experience with grief. What has the process been like for you and do you have any suggestions for me? Also, any suggestions on how I can help my mom and grandma get through this?

"My mom has dementia (likely a direct or indirect result of lifelong alcoholism) and she has recently gone through a pretty significant decline. Her sister (my aunt) came to town several years ago and basically wreaked havoc, accusing my dad of not caring for her or being ""fun,"" accusing us of not doing what we should be doing for her, and even inisisting that she should be able to drink ""in moderation."" While she and my mom have always been close, she is kind of a ""Disneyland dad"" type of family member, where she blows in and out quickly, lifts spirits, creates expectations, and then blows out again. While she and I have always been very close, and my husband and kids are also very close with her, this has really made me really minimize all contact with her (the first and hopefully last time I would ever consider myself ""estranged"" from anyone). 

To add to this, she brings other people in as backup, including another niece who specializes in getting Medicaid/Medicare to pay for elder care. This would be awesome if I could trust them not to be disruptive to an already really difficult situation, but unfortunately I can't.

I do know that it would probably give my mom a boost to see/hear from her sister, but I'm not sure if it's worth the fallout? My aunt also just texted me to ask for my mom's new address, but I'm reluctant to share it in case she tries to show up there/contact the facility directly. Any advice? Thanks so much.",1
"My Dad was recently diagnosed with early onset major FTD (Semantic Variant). I wasn’t really surprised because his behavior has been off/strange/concerning for about 2 years or so. 2020 was especially difficult for him and I truthfully didn’t see him a whole lot that year due to covid. Based on what my Mom has said, he slowly started to have issues starting then though. He had a hernia removed in 3/2021. After that, he quickly declined. Neuropsychologist said anesthesia can sometimes progress diseases like dementia. 

He was supposed to go back to work after the hernia surgery but never did. He ended up retiring and left my Mom to run their business alone. They’re both 69 now. After his surgery, he picked up heavily smoking weed again after not doing so for at least 30 years. He says he started smoking again because he feels like he’s going to have a seizure. When he was in the military in the late 60s, a Dr told him to smoke weed to help with his seizures because my Dad didn’t like the meds they gave him. He’s had scans done over the years and he does still have seizure activity in his brain but he hasn’t had a seizure in decades. 

He has ADHD but has never taken any medication to treat/help it. He used to be an alcoholic and heavily smoke weed when my parents were 1st married (~1980). He eventually quit both and I’ve never known him to really smoke or drink much in my lifetime (28). 

I think due to his ADHD and past brain traumas, he’s also had problems with making good decisions (especially when it comes to money). It’s even worse now though. Over just the last few years, he’s spent thousands on idk what and my Mom didn’t find out until he had already done a lot of damage. He’s now only limited to his disability money (he was honorably discharged) and what my Mom gives him for spending money. He’s bad about pressuring her into spending more though. He did this with me in May when we were at a restaurant that sold tea. I told him I’d buy him some. I got 2 boxes but he wanted 5. I told him no and he started to be weird about it so I got 4 because I didn’t want to cause a scene. At check out, he tried to get me to buy the 5th box again. I was firm and asked him to put it back… he got my Mom to buy it.

He unfortunately doesn’t want to cut back or quit smoking weed/delta8. He’s been spending at least $300/month on weed since beginning of 2021 (he may have started smoking some in 2020 but not to the degree he is now). Weed isn’t even legal here (TN) so he buys from a neighbor and gets delta8 vapes from local shops. He literally has no self control. We traveled for thanksgiving and he smoked 1/2 of a 1mL vape cart in 1 day. I was shocked! (I smoke sometimes but even with regular use those last me at least a month). I took it away from him (I had just bought it for him bc he didn’t bring any with them). He kept asking for it but I told him I wasn’t going to give it back until right before we left. On the car ride home, he kept vaping in the car (after I asked him not to), so I had to take it away again. I’ve tried talking to him multiple times that he needs to cut way back on smoking but he just says ok then doesn’t really change. My Mom says sometimes she comes home and he’s high out of his mind. I really think that he just smokes all day.

He has also been drinking an excessive amount of caffeinated teas. Like 15 cups a day. My Mom said he has recently cut back to just 3-5 cups a day which is great, but imo he doesn’t need any caffeine. He usually puts a lot of honey in his tea and is constantly eating cough drops (because his throat hurts from smoking). He recently had to get 2 teeth pulled because he doesn’t take care of his teeth like he should plus he eats a lot of sweets. He’s never had good teeth but he’s at least taken care of them in the past. He used to be a health nut (we rarely had sweets in the house growing up & my dad used to be obsessed with anything that seemed “healthy”).

He also only ever wants to watch The Good Witch. All the time. 

Is this common for people with dementia to struggle with addictions? Is there any way to help them? 

My Mom is looking into possible programs to help with the addiction issues for people that have dementia. We’re also wondering if it’s time to consider care homes. It’s difficult  though because he’s still there mentally (although not like he used to be), but it’s hard to tell what’s a side effect of weed and what’s FTD.",1
"My girlfriend and I have been informal caregivers for my 90-year-old neighbor since about 2015 or so. We've grown incredibly close to him.

Recently we had him admitted to the hospital because he couldn't stand up.  It took the hospital 9 days before they x-rayed his hip and revealed he fractured his hip.

So obviously, I'm infuriated with them.

He says he doesn't want to go to a nursing home. I'm trying to convey to him that if he doesn't do PT, he'll end up in a nursing home. He says he wants to do PT and then when they come and move him he complains about his legs hurting (from knee osteoarthritis on top of his hip surgery).

His dementia obviously makes this harder because he forgets he's at the hospital and thinks he's at home.

What can I do?",1
"my mom has dementia and has been in a memory care unit at a local facility since May.  Over the past couple of months she has really become a problem for them.

Mom has been irate today, screaming, hitting her walker on the wall, calling the nurses names, swinging at them.  What the hell am I supposed to do if they decide they can't handle her anymore?  I can't take her.  My family and I are not equipped to deal with her.  I have three young kids that I don't want her to be around.  They can't force me to take her can they?

"For some context, my family and I (32F) are still trying to get my grandmother a proper diagnosis. She hasn’t been the same since a heart attack and diagnosis of AFib last year. I suspect vascular dementia or maybe vascular and Alzheimer’s in the early stages. Her mother had Alzheimer’s as well as strokes and heart attacks, so family history.

Without writing a novel (because I’m so tired) she’s been saying some really mean things to me. We’ve never been that close, she’s never been a “warm” grandparent. I’m the oldest grandchild and the only one that can really assist in her care. Earlier this year she got mad over a laundry issue and told me I was going to “end up alone” (I’m currently single, never married). The last few weeks I feel like I’ve been her emotional and verbal punching bag. She doesn’t call me names really but she makes comments about my current career, education, health, etc. Last night she called me “mentally ill” in an insulting way (I have anxiety and depression, have for many years, she’s never tried to understand). Later, I was trying to have more casual conversation and mentioned a larger city I would possibly like to live in one day, she told me I wouldn’t have enough money to live there. Sometimes she rolls her eyes at me, makes faces, makes sighing noises, etc. It can also be hard to have a conversation because her social skills are a lot worse, she cuts everyone off so she can say what she wants to say, whether it’s related to the conversation or not.

I know she’s not herself but because we’ve never been particularly close, I’m having a hard time with this behavior. It just takes me back to mean things she said and did when I was a child. She was not very good to my mom (her daughter) either, so that’s also a sore spot for me. When she’s mean to my mom, I feel like I have to try to protect her and take the majority of the rude comments and eye rolling.

I just needed a place to vent. I’m sure someone here can understand. I used to hope that as she got older, we would have a better relationship. So I guess I’m grieving that as well.",1
"My family member says things like ""the Dr wanted to see how fast we could walk."" or ""They told us we have an appointment next week."" and ""We tried our best but couldn't eat all our lunch.""

My grandmother (85) had mid-late stage dementia and has other problems like very limited vision and joint pain. We try to find activities but she dislikes most of them or doesn’t want to be treated like a child. She will ignore TV and even some music. She can’t read very long or very well because of her eyesight. Doesn’t enjoy drawing or other arts and crafts types of activities. She also dislikes other common activities like folding stuff or tying things or puzzles because she doesn’t have fine motor skills and thinks they’re for children.

"Hi everyone. I’m scared my mom (63) might have vascular dementia. She just got home from an 8 day hospital stay after suffering 3 small strokes. MRI showed older mini strokes as well. From the time that she had this most recent series of strokes she’s become extremely paranoid and even delusional. Medications she was prescribed at the hospital do help, but once they start to wear off she gets very quiet, withdrawn, and can’t express herself. I’m having a hard time distinguishing stroke damage vs the possibility of dementia. Or even some sort of post-stroke psychosis? I’m only 29 myself and am navigating this more or less alone. What do I do? How does one get tested for dementia? I’m so worried for her. It’s so hard to do this alone. TIA",1
"My brother is wanting to come visit for 2 weeks, but I'm not sure it's the best idea because our grandpa has declined a lot since his last visit, specifically with sundowning. The main way it manifests is waking up at night, thinking it's morning, and starting to get ready for his day. My mom and I live with my grandpa as his caretakers, and my brother comes to visit about 3-4 times a year. Our grandpa still recognizes him, knows who he is, and knows accurate information about him like his job, so I don't worry about that. What I do worry about is my brother's schedule. He works third shift (11 PM- 7 AM), and follows this even when he's not working. Since we don't have a spare bedroom he sleeps on the couch when visiting, and the living room becomes him make-shift bedroom. This hasn't caused problems before, but with sundowning I'm concerned there could be problems. I worry that my brother having lights on, watching TV, moving around, and in general having another person awake when my grandpa should be sleeping might make him think that it's the morning. Especially with how the house is set up, as soon as he leaves his bedroom he can see the living room, so there's not way to avoid that.

While I love my brother dearly, his visits aren't really to help us out, as he is very unaware of his surroundings and doesn't have a caregiving bone in his body. His visits are to relax and visit family, not watch our grandpa. If he does watch him, we know that he's just a body to observe and do minor things like give him lunch. If something happened, like a fall, hallucination, or getting ready for the day at 2 AM, he probably wouldn't even notice or if he did he wouldn't know how to handle it and would wake us up to deal with it or call us to either rush home to deal with it or have to direct him over the phone while the emergency is happening. So on top of the worry about my grandpa thinking it's morning and getting confused, I'm worried my brother won't even notice it's happening until grandpa walks to the kitchen for breakfast at 2 AM. And once he's dressed with his bed made it's virtually impossible to get him back to bed.

Does anyone have any experience with this? Guesses as to what might happen? Suggestions on how to make it easier?",1
"Hi. My father has been struggling with forgetfulness and getting lost.  He doesn't have full dementia nor Alzheimer's yet, but I fear it's not far off.

He likes making rounds to visit people in the neighborhood and run errands to familiar places, but he sometimes forgets where he is.  After speaking with my mom about this, we wondered if an app or device might help us locate him when needed.  She thought of an Airtag synced to his phone, but I wondered if even Waze with sharing may work.

This would be done with his knowledge and permission, of course, but while he has an older iPhone he struggles with doing anything beyond calls or asking Siri and quickly gets frustrated, even giving the phone to my mom whenever he receives a text.  So I'm not sure asking him to use Waze when he's in a lost/frustrated state would work.

He almost always has his phone with him, at least. He'll often call and describe an area so we can help him figure out where he's at.

Does anyone know of a good option?  Thank you.",1
"Had a specialist in elder care visit (a friend who happens to do this for a living came into town) and we went to dinner. She spent some time with mom before hand and feels her dementia is mild at the worst.  Big sigh.  Seriously? She noted how well she did in areas that I thought she did poorly. Granted, she doesn't see all the crap I see, but big devastation to my mind.  She doesn't remember facts and requires lots of continuous explanation of things at home. Can't remember dates or times.

I mean, I don't want her to do poorly. I just was justifying her poor behavior as being due to dementia and not to, say, pure manipulation and selfishness. For example, in the last 24 hours she's stated and complained that she wants an Apple watch, an Iphone 14, a Peleton, and her license back so she can get a new car and drive again. This despite her being unable to see well, or um, walk well.  She falls continuously. Refuses to do her PT exercises.  She has the money but couldn't get on a Peleton to save her life, much less doesn't have the space for one.  She can't use her remote so I am positive she can't use an Iphone.  But she's angry and practically hisses when I try and be reasonable about it.  She's very subject to tv commercials and that's all she does is watch TV.

Thing is, this is all hitting me when I'm not my best. I'm recovering from an injury and am smack in the middle of menopause and I feel like poop all the time. I try and go and visit with her during the day (she lives with us) and try and spend time with her but I can only do a few minutes before she's driven me away with crazy requests. Part of me realizes she wants to feel vibrant and part of today's culture but you don't do that sitting in a chair.  I don't know how to help her.",1
"My mom had to be admitted to a memory care unit due to her dementia taking a turn for the worse. She has been having violent episodes. She hit one of the nurses and another resident, then she tried to break things in her room. After these episodes, she falls asleep and has absolutely no recollection of anything she did. A doctor was going to see her today to adjust her medication. I'm completely freaked out, as well as being heartbroken. My mom had home care for about six months, and every healthcare professional warned me that a change would be coming soon based on her behavior.

She was having severe hallucinations, or what her nurse called ""sundown syndrome"". Has anyone had experience with a family member having violent episodes? My mom is 94 years old, and can barely walk, but has found the energy to try to climb out of her bedroom window, and now this. Just lost.",1
"Good morning, I thought I’d share my story and I’m open to any comments or advice. My step father was diagnosed with what was thought to be Encephalitis about a year ago. He called me at work March 2021 and was saying that my mom was cheating on him and that I never want to come home because of him. This was extremely weird and out of the blue. Over the next few months he started having trouble remembering the names of household objects and he was getting “failure to perform” complaints from his work. Everything has gone severely downhill from there and he’s since gotten the correct diagnoses of Frontal Temporal Demential with ALS. A couple weeks ago my mom called me crying saying that she needs emotional support and help and now that I’m here I don’t know what the hell to do. He’s scary to be around and I know he’s scared because of what he’s going through but sometimes I’m just terrified to be in the room with him or I’m scared of getting too emotional. This disease is not about me I’m just not sure how to be helpful when I feel so scared of it and him. He can’t form words so he just groans and moans and he gets really angry around 5pm. It’s heartbreaking to watch. What should I be doing for my mom? I also feel like she’s trying to escape it… he’s only going to get worse and she’s completely checked out. She works from 6am-5pm and im home alone with him all day. I have to go back home to my job in a couple weeks and she’s hoping his Medicaid will pay for some assisted living. She refuses to change the amount she works or the totally expensive house they live in. This is all a mess and so so scary.",1
It used to happen occasionally since she's been diagnosed but for 2 weeks now i wake up everyday at 4 or 5 am *sunrise at 6:20*  to find my grandma heating food or making new recipes totally wrong and wasting materials coz she thinks we're having lunch now or someone's coming over right now or we're having a party. I believe she does that coz she's hungry but whenever i try to convince her to eat and go back to sleep she becomes very stubborn and mad and refuse to eat.,1
"I’m 19 and My grandmother is in her late 80’s with Alzheimer’s. She lives in NJ with my grandfather and family close by to help each of them. I used to call my grandmother often but lately it’s just been very hard. Hearing the same story or the same things she said in before hurts me a lot because my grandmother is still in there but just not 100%. I know this sounds selfish, but I want to remember her as she was when I was growing up and hearing her like that is just really difficult and I don’t know how to handle that I guess. Idk if I’m really looking for advice I just think I kinda needed to say this I guess idk.

"Going to try to take the keys this weekend. Combined with introducing some level of in home care. Mom’s been driving against the doctors recommendation for some time now. The letter was sent to the DMV to request her license be suspended but nothing has come of it. I really hate that I have to be the one to do this and have to do it alone. I turn 30 next week. My mom is 67 and just shy of two years into her diagnosis. She is so stubborn and she can’t understand reason. I know it’s because of her condition, but it doesn’t make it any easier. I’ve tried to have this talk a few times before but I’ve stopped short of taking the keys/car. It’s time and I know I need to buck up and handle it but I am so not looking forward to her freak out. It’s going to be a full on tantrum with lots of screaming and name calling :/",1
"How do you guys deal with your loved one who hoards in their senior care facility? They are suggesting she move into assisted living (she's in independent living now) but I don't feel she's ready for that. She's very physically functional still so it's really just memory issues that she deals with and she has a senior companion that she pays extra for to help her with this (stuff like giving her meds). 

She has always been a hoarder and it has gotten a little worse since her memory issues started. I think they're using the hoarding as an excuse to move her into AL and charge her more money. Regardless of if she's ready or not, I know the hoarding will just be an issue in her new apartment and I've been told that no place will tolerate this. So how do I deal with it? When I try to get control of her hoard, she just fights me on it. Letting her know she's in danger of having to move over this issue causes an even bigger fight! It's been very stressful and difficult to deal with.

She used to live with us in the past, and it almost ruined my life and my marriage so I'm not doing that again. I like the idea of a facility for the long term (when she's eventually ready for memory care) so that she has 24/7 supervision, but I'm just worried that no place will tolerate the hoarding and we'll continually have to worry about her getting kicked out.",1
"Its so hard.  My mother still lives independently but does not drive.  Must go to PT 2x/week and hair dresser/grocery once.  I find myself spending hours with her.  It is difficult because I work and have kids and a husband.  She is mean.   In the ways only a mother can be.  Everything she says to me is the wrong thing (about my hair, my clothes, my weight, my family).  And never happy not a single day.  And thinks shes sick everyday and cancels PT which she really needs.  When I try to arrange someone else to drive or do other tasks to give myself a break she essentially fires them.  Everyone says I should just hire someone but shes still pretty independent and doesn’t realize she needs them.  I’m feeling so bitter then I think I’m an asshole for not being able to be empathetic.  She has no one else.",1
"I posted this on caregiversupport but I figured I’d do it here too.
Hello,I’m 19 and a caregiver with my brother who’s 25 to my mom with Alzheimer’s (72) yes the ages are correct we were adopted. This is pretty awkward for me since I’m new to this but I’m really just posting for advice or any resources anyone has. My mom was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s two years ago and during COVID it increased a lot. She has other health issues as well including kidney failure so we do dialysis at home during the night. I’m in my first year of college and it’s reached a point where we need help, I’m failing my classes I’m nervous I won’t catch up enough to pass and I’ll be at risk for losing my financial aid. I already have trauma I’m trying to deal with and with this on top of it has completely crushed my mental wellbeing. I know my brother is very stressed and in a tough spot with his job since he gets called home by our mom. She’s having more delusions at night and she’s become more agitated. She wakes up during the night and tries disconnecting from her dialysis treatment and when she can’t she freaks out, it takes quite a long time to get her to sleep again, this happens often so we lose sleep a lot. When I’m at school and my brother is at work she’s at home. I tried to do online classes but for some classes that wasn’t available. It’s really just us family wise so we don’t have outside help. I know my brother has handle the legal side of this but now I’m at a loss of what to do we’re trying our best but I don’t know how much longer I can keep going if it continues like this. A lot of options I’ve seen are really expensive and we don’t have the finances for that. I don’t really know where to go from here. Who am I supposed to contact to see what our options are. Any advice is appreciated, thank you.",1
"Taking mum to meet caregiver candidate for the first time next week

My mother has Alzheimer's and I am getting help from someone who is not myself for the first time. 

The plan is to introduce them somewhere like a library and see how it goes spending a short amount of time together. I plan to still be at the place also but in the background and letting them try to get acquainted as much as possible. I thought I would introduce them as a person from their doctor's office here to do some memory games with her or something. 

The goal is to eventually I would like to build up to having respite a few hours 4 days a week.



If you've got any advice for how to go about transitioning to bringing a new caregiver into your loved ones routine, I would love to hear.",1
"Dad is 75, mid-stage Alzheimer’s. Needs light direction to eat and get places; short term is shot, but long term is still okay. Biggest issues are time and place, and visual hallucinations (which lead to diagnosis two years ago). 

Mom made quick decision last year to sell the house and get dad in AL while he can still adjust. After the initial period of getting through sundowning in a new environment, he seemed okay (“okay”). Mom was out of country for the last few months. I’ve been handling business long distance; checking medication, bills, keeping in touch with NP and managers. Any issues they related seemed mild and expected in my opinion, and I was always able to straighten him out over the phone in minutes. 

Mom is back and now they’re suddenly playing hard ball, which is obviously distressing. He entered the facility last July and was recommended level 2 care. 7 months later, they’re recommending memory care. Recently, he went out to the parking lot and knocked on the window of a vacant car, believing someone was up to no good inside. This sparked their recommendation. (He does not wander and he is a mild mannered guy.) 

We toured memory care before he entered AL last July, and Mom and I were disturbed. We will not consider memory care until he literally has no idea what is happening anymore. Dad is physically okay — usual stuff that he’s been dealing with for years (BP, cholesterol, borderline diabetic). Mom told them memory care of out of the question and will lead to his rapid decline. She asked for other options; they countered they could place him in psych ward to get his medication balanced? Mom heard “hospital” and figured that was a safe and fair option—she didn’t realize she was calling their bluff by agreeing. Two days later, the NP reversed stance and says she doesn’t think psych ward would be good for his mental health (read: no ER would accept him bcs his behaviors are not that out of line). This is the same in-house NP who made the memory care recommendation and once called me in a genuine rage because my father moved suitcases into the hallway, which I quickly resolved over the phone with him. It’s difficult for me to trust her assessment as a result.

This takes us to Monday. Dad sees a separate traveling NP affiliated with the AL as his PCP, and I receive his visit summary. It looks like AL scheduled a visit for evaluation to push the move. “Vascular dementia with behavioral issues: recommend increased supervision, possibly move to memory care.”  We’ll ignore that he has Alzheimer’s not vascular dementia; instead I’m focused on “possibly move to memory care.” “Possibly” seems to keep our options open. 

Our goal is to keep Dad where he is for a couple more months as mom and I plan their move to my state, where they can get a house in my neighborhood, and we can take care of dad ourselves with a much higher quality of care. I do not want him to experience lockup with folks who are much further along than him. He is self-aware and will recognize the environment. My mom does not have a permanent residence and is crashing with friends, so pulling him early is not an option.

(English is Mom’s second language, and Dad took care of all the finances until last year, so we are navigating a lot of “new,” and I do a lot of homework for her.)

So, my question is has anyone else experienced a memory care recommendation that they did not agree with? And if so, how did you manage the situation?",1
"My grandma lives in a over 60s community on her own in a 2 bedroom appartement. She recently had started doing some things and I need some advice on how I can stop guid her to stop these or limit them. 

1. We are about to go on vacation and my mom is helping my grandma pack and we where looking for some of her exercise shirts (she normally has 10+) but they where all gone. We have no idea where they went, we looked everywhere.

2. When packing my grandma also likes to constantly re pack, and than we have to pack again. 

3.finally she keeps re organizing her clothing, she has pants, shirts and bathing suits all in the same spot. No matter how much we try to organize it she reorganizes it at least 2-3 times a week. I’m glad she is doing it because it is keeping her up, active, and thinking. But this may be the cause of her clothing going missing. 

How can I help guid her to limit or stop some of these behaviors?",1
"I have family friends who are like grandparents (late 80s, early 90s) to me (35F).  They live in another country now.  My ""grandma"" was diagnosed with alzheimers in the past year.

Today she called me for my birthday - I'm so touched that she remembered, because she's quite clearly deteriorating.  She used to be so vibrant, so sharp.  Even in her 80s.  Today she really struggled with communicating, and not just finding words, but with general coherence.  It's just heartbreaking.

She also completely forgot that I travelled across the world to visit them four years ago.  She asked me, and was confused.  That trip was such special bonding time that I'm heartbroken feeling like it's somehow been lost.

I played it down, and said yes I visited, but didn't mention that I stayed with them for a week, or how much quality time and conversation we had.  Man, am I glad I went when I did.

How do I handle this?  How do I interact with her in a way that's the most supportive for her?  I know to give people lots of time to find words and talk, and not finish their sentences or guess.  But do I remind her of things?  Does that make it better or worse?

Just looking for any tips and suggestions on how to interact and maintain a relationship.  All my bio-grandparents died when I was young, and I don't have a lot of family support to help me navigate.",1
"Last November my mom who never calls me or emails me, starting sending me a few emails a day, somedays she would call me- it was all about the fact that people were breaking into her email and bank accounts. The emails or calls sounded like someone on drugs. She would talk about the mail then shift to a movie or the weather being bad. She was always in a state of anxious panic about the world. This then extended to people 'breaking into my parents house' and 'messing things up' or taking random papers/mail my mom was certain was there the day before. This accelerated to 'people are living under the stairs' and 'come into the house when we are not here to take our juice/milk/coffee' etc. My parents have a security system, they live in a neighborhood where people would see if someone was breaking in etc.  My dad when he was able to be alone for a few seconds said none of this was happening from what he can tell. He pleaded with me to find a security person to come check out their house as he was sure this would deal with it (obviously it did not). 

She seemed to then stop sleeping to 'watch over the house' and then started to demand that she or my dad were always home/are always home so that no one breaks in. She does not allow my dad to leave the house easily (they are both retired) so that everything is protected. As far as I know, she has lost a lot of weight and goes between thinking my dad and I are the enemy to crying a lot over the smallest things for hours when she never used to cry. 

My dad managed to somehow get her in for an MRI at some point, they found no degeneration of her vessels, no tumor etc. She went to a psychiatrist who Rxed her some medications but she refused to take them. At some point s/he ran urine to check for drugs- the drug results were negative but she had a bad UTI. She would not take the antibiotics but somehow my dad got her to do this. 

My dad is basically trapped in the house from what I can tell (I live sadly 20 hours by plane away, literally on the other side of the world) and yet, he has not been willing to, from what I can tell, accept the fact that she needs comprehensive medical checks etc. I am feeling absolutely frustrated and unsure what or how to proceed. I have considered calling an ambulance, police for a wellness check, etc but there doesn't seem to be a solution for someone who isn't posing some immediate danger to themself or people around them. Is there some other solution/options I have? I am not able to travel there at the moment until my residency permit is renewed but I would like to find a way to give my dad some relief as he isn't able to advocate or rationalize with my mom and does not stand up to her range/temper/tears and find some answers to why my mom flipped from what was a mostly normal person when I saw her in September to this in the period of a few weeks.",1
"My dad has been going downhill quickly for the last few months. He started having delusions last fall, thinking that the neighbors wanted to break in and steal from him. We started him in daycare earlier this month and then added home health care a few days a week, but he’s fought everything. Now he’s forgotten who my mom is (his wife of fifty plus years), doesn’t believe she’s his wife because his wife was brunette and thin and mom is now fat and grey haired. He thinks my sister (who has short hair) is moms boyfriend. He screams and berates everyone. But weirdly he talks about my husband of less than three years a lot and asks when he’s coming to visit. We live about 3,500 miles away so he’s only met my husband on two week long visits.  🤷🏻‍♀️ 

Dad won’t eat, drink water, or take his meds. We had to call in 24 hour care starting tonight and we’re meeting with our elder care consultant to get him into a MCU this week. Mom has given up. She can’t care for him anymore. She doesn’t feel safe and the stress of trying to care for him is creating a lot of health issues for her.  So, she’s done. 

I think mom is finally realizing dad is gone. This is something I accepted a few months ago so it’s made it easier for me to deal with things pragmatically. I’m glad mom is finally at this point. She needs to put herself first. We’ve done what we can for dad. Putting him in a MCU feels like a loss AND a light at the end of the tunnel at the same time. 

I just needed to share that. My friends and husband have been great but it’s nice to vent to people who are in the same boat.",1
My mom is showing all the signs of early onset Alzheimer’s. I’m taking her to the doctor in a little over a week for her first appointment with her primary care provider. She’s slowly slipping away from reality and I’m supposed to start college in august. I have nothing but anxiety thinking about the future and what will happen to my life regarding caring for my mom.

"We admitted my dad in memory care two weeks ago. Physically he looks “normal” - no walker, wheelchair, but his mind is going quick. So far, I’ve visited 4-5 times a week but the last few times he’s been asking me to break him out. Today, he wanted me to bring him out and I got so frustrated explaining to him that I can’t, I left memory care, cried the entire way home to my husband and kids, swearing that I need a break from visiting, at least for a couple of days. The emotional toll is unreal. 

I booked a conference room at the facility for his 71st birthday in a few weeks. It’s in the assisted living side, not memory care so I’m fully responsible for him and getting him back to his room. We didn’t invite many people, mostly his siblings, and none of them live local. I’ve felt judged by them for putting my dad in a home but those feelings might be my guilt eating up at me. I stand by my decision. It’s just hard. 

I’m starting to think this “party” is a terrible idea. In my head, I see this wholesome, “Brady bunch” event but I continue to have high expectations for this disease and it bites me in the ass every single time.

I want my dad to see his siblings. Just nervous if he focuses on getting out the whole time. Wish he would enjoy the moment but, like I said, my expectations are too high. This is my first time dealing w this disease and it sucks.

Should I have the party? Should I change my approach w anything? I was going to tell the attendees that he is in no way allowed outside the room unless he is with me.",1

At the moment is mostly short term memory that’s not there, and she’s constantly thinking people are out to get her (stealing money from her, hate her, etc)

Most recently the target has been me.

I don’t live anywhere near here, so my contact with her is phone calls.

Last I spoke to her, it was my birthday earlier this month and things were wonderful. I was on vacation and things were going well.
I got home from vacation and had a week of Covid, I missed 3 calls from her while I was sick, had family tell her I was really sick, and figured I’d call her back when I was well.

Unfortunately my covid was followed by getting laid off my job the day I returned .
That was last week. Needless to say, my morale is in the shitter, and I haven’t wanted to talk to anyone.

Last week my mother tells me I need to call grandma because she thinks I hate her and is crying everyday and no one can convince her I don’t.

I’m a terrible liar and just can’t put on a smiling voice and lie to my grandma that everything is okay. I also don’t want her to know how miserable I am right now, that will crush her.

I know she doesn't qualify for social security until the age of 62 but what other kind of help from the government could she qualify for? Disability?

"I’m a 22 year old female in her last year of college and my mother called me earlier today saying that my fathers neurologist suspects he has early onset Alzheimer’s. (Not 100% confirmed, still waiting on ruling out other things). I’m not sure what the first steps are in processing this information as most kids my age I feel like aren’t really having this sort of reality check. Wondering if anyone has any advice for me, especially regarding having an increased risk for Alzheimer’s myself if that’s the diagnosis?",1
"So a friend of a friend (literally my coworker’s best friend who’s his pastor that’s been like his mentor for years) has been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s. From what my friend told me, it’s genetic; the pastor had taken care of his father who had it (and was very aggressive) while they’ve been taking care of the pastor’s older brother who also has it fully but is more passive (buddy told me the brother kind of just stomps softly and claps because he can’t express himself).
So the pastor doesn’t want to end up the same way and even tried to off himself but my friend managed to stop him. I don’t mean to make light of the situation but to me it’s kind of like knowing you’re going to turn into a zombie, especially after the other guy has seen the effects first hand, and I wondered if anyone had advice? 
To me this is worse than a death sentence because you’re going to slowly become imprisoned in your own body and I’m not advocating the pastor off himself but to me it would be my first reaction too. He’s married but his wife has been in the hospital lately for some chronic stomach problem he’s unsure about and I’m certain my friend would help take care of the pastor like they’ve been doing with his brother. He’s already asked my friend to help off him (the pastor) once he’s fully gone, again a zombie metaphor seems apt to me, but of course he refused. 
I didn’t know if anyone had someone close that went through this and I’m not saying people with this disease should be culled or kill themselves, merely expressing my own selfish fear if I was faced with such a fate as it’s not like fighting cancer that could finish you off but to me it seemed a tragic curse that you’ll forget everything up to and including how to communicate or how bodily functions work. The pastor is in his early fifties and I’m in my forties so maybe that’s why I’m so concerned with mortality but would genuinely like some suggestions or hear stories of what others have done to help family members diagnosed with this.",1
"My mum has later stage Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. She can't see and struggles to speak now too. Her husband is a difficult man and has a history of neglecting her. It's becoming clear that he isn't giving her  much, if any, water and she doesn't remember to ask. She had a UTI this week and fell over. I've tried to talk to him about it and have been quite stern and clear about the dangers of dehydration but he ignores me. 

I don't live nearby but visit every two weeks. Does anyone have any suggestions to help my mum get more water in her? Even if she did want a drink, she can't get it herself as she can't see. He will fetch it for her if she asks though. Someone suggested a reminder on Alexa which I will try, but any other tips would be great. Thanks.

Edit - she has carers twice a day to help her with basics, my sister visits the weekends I'm not there and we are both in touch with social services and available if there is an emergency.

"My dad recently has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. He and my mom are in their mid-70s and are not very tech literate. One of the ways that his short term memory is affected at this early stage is he constantly forgets passwords to different websites and ends up changing passwords frequently. He has a little notebook and random pieces of paper and by now things like ""Gmail"" have 5-6 different passwords all scratched out and it is a complete mess. I would like to help manage this and go through his passwords and simplify things, however set it up in a way where if he tries to change things I am alerted or he has to go to me for help. I'm in a different state so this would need to be done remotely. I've tried introducing them to 1Password which is what I use, but it is such a foreign concept to them and they could never figure out the auto-fill that it failed miserably.

My father doesn't know how to move his body properly anymore, he can't walk and he can only stand up with the help of two people or a walker and one person.  

It seems like he also forgot how to ""push"" when he needs to poop. I'm almost convinced that he's actively holding it in even while he's yelling in pain and praying to God for help.  I take him to the toilet when he complains and I sit there in the bathroom coaching him through it for sometimes 2+ hours as he yells in agony. We give him laxatives and food thats supposed to make bowel movements easier but it's not helping. Has anyone else had this problem?  He only finally poops when it has explosive force behind it and unfortunately half the time that's into his diaper and not the toilet. 

It really hurts to see him in so much pain for such extended periods of time. It's like he's being tortured in front of me and I can't do anything to stop it.",1
"Someone in my family let her drive. She shouldn't be driving. We took her car almost a year ago to prevent this. She got really lost and an ambulance came, police came, they took her license and the police gently scolded my family member for letting her drive with Alzheimer's. She must've been so confused and scared. I feel so helpless. I just want to hug her forever.

Getting lost like that was my mom's biggest fear. It broke her when it happened to her mother, she talked about it often. I'm hoping she won't remember but that was so scary. 

I just need to vent because I'm so mad, sad, feel helpless and heartbroken.",1
" Hi everybody,

My mom was diagnosed spring 2022 and lives alone in a different city, so I started using “smart home tech” to make sure she was ok and can be notified of any issues. While discussing my installation in my local support group, the feedback I received was very interesting and the one thing which stood out was that I was alone thinking this way and using these tools.

From there I documented what I did and converted a hobby into something I hope will prove useful for all in our common context, and published it at [www.alzheimerstech.com](http://www.alzheimerstech.com/). This site is my personal initiative which will hopefully lend a hand to others and there is no commercial angle to this at all.  I simply wish to give back and help.

Any feedback is of course appreciated and feel free to share with anyone or any organization you feel may benefit from this information.

Cheers,  
JP",1
"She's fiercely independent. She taught my dad to drive when they were dating in the early 80s because she wouldn't date a guy without a car. A few years later she taught him how to drive a stick shift because she was pregnant and couldn't fit behind the wheel of her car, which was bigger and they needed the space for a weekend trip. 

She still knows the city like the back of her hand and I still call her for directions because it's one of my favorite things about her. I know the GPS will tell me the same route but it doesn't know that we like that one gas station that's always 10 cents cheaper than anywhere in that neighborhood. It doesn't know  my next turn is the church where I had girl scouts in the basement or where the bowling alley used to be. It's not going to tell me that she learned that shortcut from her supervisor when she worked for Visiting Nurses or where the free parking spots are when I go downtown. When she's giving me directions, it's the only time I feel like I truly have her back.

She's an urban explorer with an excellent memory built for maps. She was my biggest champion for road trips and travel, even at a young age, even as a solo woman. When her oldest sister passed 14 months ago, my cousin asked me to speak at the funeral. I told the story about how they rented an RV in the late 70s and drove across the country on an adventure, with my aunt barely able to sign the rental papers. My mom, who was maybe 19, is doing the bulk of the driving while my aunt tended to the younger siblings and cousins in tow. People asked where the adults were and told them to turn around but they just laughed. They were fearless.

We tried as long as we could to let her drive. She started doing Uber to make money on the side after she retired before she got an official diagnosis. We hoped the memory issues were indications of low blood sugar or medications interacting in weird ways. It couldn't be dementia; she wasn't even 60 at the time. After the diagnosis, we stopped letting her drive strangers around, but she could still go somewhere if she took a friend or family member. She wanted to drive Uber last month and I told her she hasn't driven in a couple years and she was so belligerent I hung up on her, which was the second time I'd done it in my life. I called my sister, upset because Mom doesn't talk to us like that. Sister called her 10 minutes later and everything was fine, back to normal, her memory wiped of the whole conversation.

Still, we didn't want to take her car keys because they are her lifeline. We had a GPS tracker on her phone and air tags in the car and a network of people keeping tabs on her.  But over the last few weeks it was evident that the time has come. The bad days now outweigh the good days no matter who she's with. Today, Dad took her car around the block, put it in the garage, and disconnected the battery. I guess the only silver lining is that she'll believe us if we tell her the car needs work and her brain can't handle the task of acquiring a rental (Seriously, the woman has never been without access to a car for more than a few hours unless she was on a cruise or abroad). 

Dad sent me a text after it was done. Nobody but my dog knows how hard I cried when I read it. It feels like we took her voice or cut off her legs. He car is an extension of her, decorated inside with all her favorite things, Cincinnati Bengals, Mickey Mouse, and her church. And now it will sit. This symbol of my once vibrant, mobile mother is now being held hostage in the garage, a casualty of a cruel disease. 

I miss my mom.

Sorry this is so long. Thanks for sticking with it.

TL;DR is the title.",1
"Dad has started to leave without saying anything to Mom.  Only happened twice, and he just went to a sitting area.  So looking to get her one of those door alarms that make a ding dong type sound when the door opens.  But I need the speakers to be in the bedrooms, not at the door.  Anyone have any product recommendations?",1
"So my husbands grandmother has stage 6 alzheimer's. My MIL was walking her in the mall and she fainted in the middle of the mall (assisted fall) . She had to get rushed to the hospital. The doctors said there was no sign of a stroke but they still have no idea what could've triggered the fainting spell. She has to stay in the hospital now because she can't walk as well after this incident and also to be monitored. 

I was wondering if anyone had experienced this before? Does this mean she soon will no longer be able to walk? Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",1
"It's been 5 months since my dad was diagnosed with alzhimer's at 67yo..

Couple of updates from my old posts. 

My mom and dad just went on vacation for a week and came back.

When my dad came back he was talking so much and remembering the trip. 

He felt somewhat normal/improved.. compared to the daily life of his constant repetition. 

But now that he's back home, he's back to his normal repetition. He doesn't talk much, just constantly changing his clothes, opening doors, turning on and off things. Over and over and over again. 

He's so stubborn. He's angry. He's quiet. He's confused. 

We tell him over and over to stop doing those things but it never happens. Now we just kinda live with it. 

Vacation or a change of environment seem to help a little. Maybe I should get a dog for him to walk or bond with...",1
"So my mom is 64 and has early onset, she started getting symptoms about 10 years ago and at this point she can't remember how to do laundry, no longer has a license/car, doesn't work, doesn't really remember how to properly do dishes, can't prepare many foods (a few very easy ones), and she is no longer showering well, washing her hair, etc. We believe it's time for her to go into a memory care facility.

Since August, my brother and his family have lived in her house with her and taken care of those chores and things that she can't do. But they have two dogs and a young son and they need their own space, so they're moving into their own house in maybe 6 weeks. Which means she'll be going into memory care before then.

We knew even before she ever had Alzheimer's that she had no desire to ever go into assisted living (I mean, who really does), no desire for people to help her, etc. But obviously it's what is necessary. We had a brief talk with her maybe a month ago and she would get very upset at times, saying how people were ""forcing her to leave"", kicking her out of her house, etc. She's definitely not happy about it. Of course.

She absolutely doesn't understand that she's not able to take care of herself (she says things like ""but I've always lived in this house and it's been fine!""), and doesn't ever acknowledge or seem to remember that she has Alzheimer's (or even what that means). So I don't think there's a chance she'll come around to the idea of needing to be around people who can help her 24/7, having that community, etc

A few people have suggested lying to her about why she's needing to leave. Which honestly makes me feel really gross, especially if it's a lie that needs to be upheld over time (like someone suggested telling her there's a gas leak at the house and then we'd need to keep telling her ""nope not fixed yet, gotta stay here a while longer""). I don't know, that just makes me feel really wrong. But in some ways I think a lie (maybe a more creative one than that) could make the process easier for her, and make her resent us less for this. Thoughts???",1
"For the past two weeks or so, my grandmother is convinced that she stayed (and are continually staying) at someone else’s house that looks just like hers in a town about an hour and 30 from where she lives. 

It started when she said “what are we doing here?” Confused my mother and I told her that we’re home. And she refused to believe she was in her town at her house that she has owned for about 50 years. She called her son (uncle), his wife (aunt) and my cousin to ask why she wasn’t home. On top of everybody that she could trust, she asked why we moved all of her stuff into this other  house that “nearly” looks the same. The family is keenly aware of my grandmothers worsening condition. We get that we have to go along with my grandmothers stories for the most part but we’re at a loss when it comes to her saying that she’s not home or in the town she currently lives in. 

She’s convinced that we’re playing some “game” with her and “why we won’t tell her the truth”. Like many other cases she wants to go to her childhood home, and like many of those cases she can’t go there as someone else lives there. What should I do?",1
"Well, we finally pulled the trigger. Mom is now in memory care. She was officially diagnosed with early onset in 2017 at age 65 (it likely started developing several years earlier). We did the best we could for as long as possible, but it was time for this to happen. My Dad took her in last week after many months of careful research, consulting with his support group, and visiting over a dozen facilities in the area.

So far it’s been about what you’d expect….a rough first few days but now my Mom seems more or less okay. I’m not as sure about my Dad…..he’s taking it really, really hard for obvious reasons. They’ve been married for almost 45 years and now she’s gone and he’s by himself. I’m gutted for him and I don’t know what to say. All my siblings and relatives have reached out and assured him this was right and no one thinks otherwise, but you know how it is. Did anyone here have a similar situation? What did you do to help your parent who was the caretaker? This rotten disease has taken my Mom from me and I don’t want it to do the same thing to my Dad….",1
"Being an Alzheimer’s caregiver is isolating. I love my mother. She is a couple years into Early Onset Alzheimer’s. Today I helped my mom take a shower. I’ve been sick for around a week so I haven’t been around to help care for my mom. She lives with my Dad where my sister and I both work. She is 58 and I am 27. I came in today and learned my mom hadn’t showered for over a week. We know that’s not abnormal for people with Alzheimer’s, but showering is a necessary cleanliness thing. So, today I made it happen. My mom HATES being cold so I turned down the temp in the house a little and then after the air kicked in I turned the shower on and got it nice and steamy. Using that tactic I convinced her to shower. Trying to get her into the shower was the next struggle. As I stood there, with the door open enough to watch her surreptitiously in the mirror, I tired to coach her on how to take off her clothes and get in the shower. She sat on the toilet and went through the process of wiping and flushing multiple times, she continuously took on and off her clothes because she couldn’t understand what was going on. I had to continually redirect her until she finally got in the shower. I then coached her through the whole process. The whole time when she wasn’t talking to me she was muttering to herself; coaching herself, saying randomly seemingly nonsensical things, and asking herself questions about what was going on. We got through the process. My mom is a truly wonderful woman. As her daughter I invaded privacy in a big way. Her reaction wasn’t anger or anything other than pure gratitude that I was helping her. She kept hugging me and crying, saying “I’m so glad you and your sister are my daughters” and “I don’t know how to thank you”. That breaks me. She feels so guilty for needing help , she’s always been like that and this has only amplified it. I’m overwhelmed. I’m sad. I’m lonely. This type of pain isn’t something anyone I know understands. I’m 27 and I saw my mother totally naked today and helped her to a complete a basic human process.  I don’t know how to explain this to anyone. I think I’m looking for some understanding.",1
"I haven't visited my dad in memory care since Christmas. I feel kind of bad but I don't think he even notices. His sister's have been visiting so he gets guests. I mainly worry the staff are judging me. It just gets so tiring driving out there for a 15 minute visit of talking at him.

-edit-

I guess i should have done a bit more exposition. 

He's non-verbal and late stage. He has a completely different personality and loses interest in guests after a few minutes. We never had a close relationship, but I'm the oldest and POA so I feel a sense of obligation for everything. I've been the one that got him a diagnosis, found him caregivers, then found him memory care, takes care of finances, have to clean out and sell his home, all the while I'm in my 30s trying to balance a full time job, my family, my home, and making ends meet. I suppose the issue is I resent his illness and it's burden on my life. I know that's selfish, but I'm just so damn tired.",1
"My dad, 70, just doesn't seem to care about the date or day of the week. Otherwise, his concept of time is good. For example, if I don't talk to him for three days, he would tell me that or if I ask him when did he last talk to his brother, he would be pretty close, maybe off by a day or two. It is always by days, not by date. For example, "" I talked to him about 10 days ago and Not I talked to him on Feb 3rd"".

Other than that he can hold a conversation, talk about current affairs, come up with a solution to a problem but for some reason has stopped giving a damn about the time and day. Just says I am retired why should I care about the date. All he knows is we are in winter and he needs to dress accordingly. His recent memory is not crisp but par for the person his age. He has been in this state for a good two years now.

Too stubborn to see a neurologist but these are surely early signs. 😭",1
"I’m so worried. My mom is 62, so she’s young still but my uncle had Alzheimer’s around this age and my grandma was diagnosed around 77 and passed away at 89. 

My mom also drinks a lot so my family always reassures me that’s the issue. 

She is still sharp, but she easily forgets little details. Such as I told her I have a TV stand, and then 1 hour later she’s worried about what TV stand I’m going to use. She’s easily agitated in the mornings, but I sometimes think that’s because she hasn’t drank a beer yet. I’m so worried. I’m 23 and having a baby next week. She’s my support.

Any advice would be appreciated.",1
"Since my mother diagnosis it’s been difficult seeing things slowly disappear. The day I realised she can no longer write (and she had beautiful handwriting) was a tough one.

But this weekend we celebrated my fathers birthday. We had a watermelon that was sitting on the counter and someone suggested that it would be better to be kept cold. About 10 minutes later my partner asked why the watermelon was in the bath tub. 
Apparently mum tried to put it in a cool place and ended up putting it in the bath.

It breaks my heart a little, but also had a giggle about it. Gotta laugh when you can, eh?",1
"I just need someone to talk to. My mom has early onset, she’s 58 and has been suffering with this official diagnosis since age 50. She fell and injured her head in a complete accident, a family caregiver sat her on the edge of bed to dress her and when caregiver turned for a second mom went over. She had sutures and stitches from hitting the side of her wheelchair and has a what will be a huge scar down on her forehead now. I am physically ill over this, it feels like a bad bad dream. My mom is 58, she shouldn’t have this huge scar and staples in her head from falling.

I’m distraught. This illness has robbed my mom of everything- her mind, her dignity, and now, her looks. (She is still beautiful but holy shit I am so upset about her forehead.) she was so, so beautiful and the least vain person I knew. She was so humble and kind. I feel sick to my stomach over it. She’s nonverbal, nonambulatory. It makes me sick that she can’t communicate her needs, if she is in pain, and that now she is suffering from this accident. Her brain scans came back normal injury wise, but showed atrophy of the brain (of course) and this is just breaking my heart. 

I’m 26. I’ve been losing my mom slowly for over ten years now. I feel so alone and so upset that she just keeps suffering. I have no one to go to. I just need some reassurance, something. This disease is the worst thing one could wish upon anyone.",1
"At a fairly young age of mine, my father expressed that he was treated badly by his mother and stepfather. He wouldn't expound on it when asked yet we all seem to have a great relationship with grandma and granddad (his parents). Later, in my teens, I asked his brother and sister about growing up in the household. They had ""no issues"" per se. So I asked about my fathers claims. I was informed that he was a tenacious force. One that was just defiant above all else. Would tell a lie just because the opportunity was at hand. In short, he got his ass ""torn up"" on a regular basis. He entered the Army at 18 to avoid the draft for the Vietnam War. He gained discipline there and the man I grew up with was far different from the described child by his siblings. This man was kind and gentle with a heart of gold. He ""tore up"" mine and my brothers assess too but it was when Mom said. He never took the initiative just because. 

When his Alzheimer's started setting in, he slowly became more and more childlike in a lot of ways. Not just childlike, but HIS childlike. The same as it was so many years ago. Today, outside of the confusion and behaviors that go with the disease, he is a child at times. But he is the EXACT child he was so long ago. He knows what he is doing is wrong and tries to be sneaky. Oh my damn at the sneaky. It always fails because I pay attention. I just let it go...

...until yesterday. I'd had a bate. I went the fuck off and I shouldn't have but I did. There was no ""reset"", no ""5 second Tom"", no forgetting. Today, he hasn't even acknowledged my presence. He pouting. He remembers.

"My mom is still with me but she can't really communicate very well. Just one word here and there. I know I'm very fortunate to still have that and she still gets excited to see me. As well as what little bit of her life she does have in her seniors home. My question to all of you is, for those who have lost their loved ones to Alzheimer's, is there anything you look back on and wish you did with them while they were still here with you, or can you recommend anything you're so fortunate for doing while you could?

I want this to be something others can read and use because it's not always easy to think of things while you're in the moment, and sometimes it can be so upsetting to realize you missed an opportunity that you didn't think of at that time. Whether it's taking them somewhere. Making something with them. Just sharing a wonderful experience with them.",1

My 85yo father has three blocked coronary arteries and a dodgy aortic valve, and we're waiting to see if we can get an op done in time but there's no space on the waiting lists, and I'm terrified I'm going to lose him within the next month. And I'm comforting myself that he doesn't have dementia. 

Nothing to say except 'this sucks', really.",1
"In the first paragraph I will provide context and details as to how we have arrived to where we are at. In the second paragraph I will summarize what it is that I need help with.

My mothers Alzheimer's is progressing. She's 66 years old and was diagnosed 6 years ago. One of the few activities she partakes in is words with friends(online mobile app that is essentially scrabble). For the past 2 1/2 years she has been meeting new people via the app that have become very problematic. These people lure her into other apps IE google hangouts which is now google chat, whatsapp, email and calls and texts. These relationships quickly move into the romantic realm where eventually intimate photos are exchanged. These relationships have caused much hardship for the family. These individuals have extorted her multiple times for upwards of $10,000. At first it was for citizenship for a certain middle eastern country so that she could then marry ""Fazzah"" an oil sheek and then unlock his family's wealth. Then there was fraudulent activity within her bank accounts due to her cashing so many fake checks. I've found her sharing banking access codes with these individuals, you know the ones you get that say in the text message ""do not share this code with anyone trying to contact you."" The latest of successful efforts by these thieves is gaining access to her AT&T account. I found after the fact that she had shared the passcode to the account along with photos of the front and back of her ID. With this information they charged 5 new lines of service and 5 new iPhone 14 pros to the account. I filed a claim with AT&T's fraud department and after an investigation they determined there was no fraud on the account so we had to cough up the $4,500 for the cost of the phones just to shut down the lines to avoid paying the service fees. My father and I have been begging and pleading with her this whole time to stop communicating with these individuals. But she won't, she has promised in the past and has reneged on the promise multiple times. My father and I are at wits end primarily due to all the time that is spent cleaning up the messes created by these fraudsters. Before I went to work to try and clean up the mess that is currently going on with the phones I had her sign a contract. This contract stated that she would not continue to be in contact with these people and if she is found to be doing so then her iPhone and iPad will be taken away. Well the time came and we had to take her devices from her. This was extremely hard for her and myself, she seemed to be more depressed and withdrawn than I've ever seen her and this breaks my heart. Within a week of her devices being taken from her she winds up in the ER complaining of chest pains. While in the ER she mentions something along the lines of wanting to die, which is something she has expressed to me many of times over the past few years. She is then committed to the senior behavioral center. She spends a week there, upon her release they called for a family meeting.

A ""family meeting"" was called for upon release of my mother from the senior behavioral center(aka senior psych ward). In this meeting both her Doctor and case manager seemed to think that it should be a simple fix in order to allow her access to her iPad/iPhone. They suggested a parental app or simply not allowing her access to large sums of money. My dilemma is 90% of the reason she wants her devices back is to play words with friends. Words with friends is where she meets people that take advantage of her and have extorted her for upwards of $10,000. My thoughts are as long as she has access to simply being able to make calls or texts these people will continue to find her in words with friends and extort her. I've looked into some what I believe are newer settings within apple devices. Under screen time you have many of options to lock the device out of say downloading new apps or making purchases without entering a passcode that cannot be reset without the person who initiates it Apple ID/PW. I've also looked into Bark which is a parental control/monitoring app. I'm in the middle of setting it up and testing it. However from my findings it seems as though this app primarily monitors time spent on certain apps and then screens for certain key words used. I believe what I need is something more along the lines of complete observation of what she's doing and say typing into the devices because I believe as long as she's on words with friends then there is a way she can get roped into yet another scam. So my question to you redditors is how do I move forward? Have any of you as caregivers run into similar problems? Do I simply not give her back her devices? Do I return her devices to her but have her locked out of words with friends?

Thanks in advance. Any advice given will be greatly appreciated.",1

"My mil was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s about 4 years ago. The decline has been swift and dramatic. My husband has not coped well with her decline and has been fighting depression throughout this time. My mil was recently move to a nursing home and my husband visited for the first time yesterday. He completely fell apart during and after the visit. He was not coping well prior to the move, but last night felt different. He couldn’t sleep, stayed up late, and got drunk. He starts therapy again this week and has been making a lot of positive changes over the past few months. I am worried that continuing to visit his mom will completely break him and undo all the progress he has made toward better mental and physical health. My real question is, do I continue to encourage him to visit her or should I suggest he step away for a while? We have no idea how much time she has left, but she has qualified for hospice in our state. I do not want him to miss his last chances to spend time with his mom, but I also hate seeing him break down and spiral after every visit. This spiral pattern is not new, but had been better over the last several months before the move. I am at a loss of how to help him.",1
"What can we do to keep her busy without disrupting the household?

She wants to wash dishes or sweep, we have a roomba and a dishwasher. If she washes the dishes, we have to rewash them anyway.

"I'm sure many of you can relate. My mom is 64 and has early onset. She's had symptoms (that we know of) for probably 10 years now. Of course more mild at first but she has declined a lot, mentally, in the past year in particular. 

I think the combination of the vague prognosis (like up to 20 years' survival time is pretty wide open), the fact that it is generally referring to ""time of diagnosis"" implying, I assume, that it's up to 20 years from the START or at least the early days of symptoms, and then the fact that my mom is, physically, in great shape is very confusing for us. I think it's hard to know a disease has taken a hold of your loved one when they are healthy in every other way (and therefore it's almost an ""invisible"" disease in that sense, like if you saw my mom out walking you'd never think she was terminally ill).

Those of you who may have had loved ones who have gotten to the very end stage of Alzheimer's or passed from it, how did symptoms progress at the end? It feels like mentally my mom is nearing the end stage in many ways (can't remember who we are very often but knows we are familiar, doesn't remember how to do dishes or wash her hair, can't even remember the biggest events in her life that used to be her oft repeated stories, etc), but it still seems impossible to imagine her dying or even becoming completely dependent.",1

She’s going to forget me. And I’m absolutely breaking apart.

It all went downhill when we put her in a carehome. She was just walking around the house all day crying and confused, poor thing. Our animals gave her so much joy when we visited her whole face just lit up. The carehome had cats and flower arranging and we just thought it looked great. Within a week she was in the hospital, bladder infection, it's gone downhill so fast.

When she has her good days she mostly just asks questions a lot and we’ll usually just have to answer the same questions and have the same conversations. But the last few days she’s been having some bad days. On these days she’s worked up which makes her more forgetful and also frequently angry. Sometimes she even gets angry over scenarios that aren’t real. For instance today she said she kept hearing a “kid on a bike” out in our yard and was really mad about. I couldn’t do anything about it though because it wasn’t actually happening, I don’t know where shes getting that scenario from but it’s impossible to help when it’s not real. I tried calming her down and pretending to go tell the kid to leave but it didn’t work cause she said she could still hear it. And when we do calm her about something a few minutes later she’ll forget and get angry about it again. I’m trying really hard to help in the best way I can but it can be frustrating and overwhelming at times. I feel bad for getting frustrated, I just want to help my gram.",1
"My father just turned 80 and has had dementia for a few years now. This week it has taken a turn. He drove 60 miles away from home confused, wanting to attend a church. He was found by police, and later at a hospital where he had collapsed. He is now back at home stable, but forgets to take his meds, blood sugar, and eat. I'm currently taking care of him, but wondering what is next. I've been recommended a guardianship or conservatorship. He lives in Texas if that makes any difference.   
Any suggestion on next steps? Talking to a lawyer tomorrow. Anyone else been in this situation?",1
"I just joined this sub and I can't thank you all enough. My dad (68) has had Parkinson's disease for over 7 years and was diagnosed with Alzheimer's this year. Today was a really tough day filled with aggression, verbal abuse, and lots of anxiety. My dad was begging to go to our church and ended up yelling at one of the religious figures we don't know well. The religious figure threatened to call the police if he kept yelling and I just ended up crying in the gardens.

Dad lacks empathy towards me and gets more frustrated seeing me cry. He's always been a stubborn angry man but this disease is making it worse. I was starting to spiral and have a panic attack as we drove home. Thankfully my brother (26M) helped him into the house so I (23F) could just go to my room.

This sub has been my comfort space. The posts here make me feel like I have friends who understand what I'm going through. I have great people in my life who want to be there for me and comfort me but they haven't lived through all of this yet. Their parents are healthy and working (We can talk about my envy towards people my age with healthy parents/mentors another day). Both of mine are battling chronic illnesses that will eventually kill them (my mom has sle and chf). I hate trauma dumping on my friends. Instead of telling all of them the same thing about how shitty things are, I post little vlogs to a private Snapchat story. If they wanna watch they can, if they don't they don't have too. But at least I get to put my emotions out there and vent about stuff while still sharing how things are really going. And thankfully my brother and I are both in therapy and my mom is starting soon. 

Being as young as my brother and I am, things have been really difficult to figure out on our own. We don't have high-paying jobs, savings or a lot of family who can support us. The family we do have really doesn't understand how difficult things are for my brother and me. They are dismissive and my dad isn't very nice to them so I can't blame them. I'm trying to go to grad school online before things get even worse so I can support them better financially.

I'm learning a lot through this sub about what is ahead for us and just trying to take things day by day. Thankfully I have also been able to access a lot of resources and social services for our family and am very grateful. Thank you to all of you who choose to be vulnerable and love your family members for who they are, not what Alzheimer's has created. Whenever I'm sad I come to this corner of Reddit and feel so seen, and I thank you.",1
"I can’t stop thinking about my dad’s death. I wonder if the nursing home neglected him or if he had sepsis and no one knew. I keep seeing the horrible image of what he became at the end in my mind.

He had gotten Covid and had to be hospitalized. When he was there he got a uti and bladder infection. They released him to a nursing home and within 10 days he died. He was so skinny and wouldn’t eat or drink much and last 4 days. They never changed his diet to purée when I asked or called us about him not eating much. We asked to talk to the doctor everyday, but no one called us.

I know he could had suffered the last stage of dementia for a long time…when I saw him after he just got out of the hospital and was at the nursing home he couldn’t talk really and stared into space. 

I just keep feeling like we did something wrong. Like we should had taken him home and not the nursing home…I wish they would had released him from the hospital earlier but they said they couldn’t because he had covid and then because of the bladder infection. The hospital claimed he was eating and talking and smiling…before he was brought to the nursing home. 

Feel maybe it was our fault partly he got so sick at the nursing home because we left him there. When Mom saw him after he got to the home she thought he was just very tired from everything. He was knocked out.

He just seemed to decline so so fast. And stopped eating so fast. I feel so sad and feel he must had been so scared when he was in the Covid area trapped alone. It breaks my heart. 

I miss him so much. I hate this horrible disease.",1
"I am writing in hopes of some good suggestions to help my mother deal with the loss of our family dog of 17.5 years. My mother was diagnosed on August 16th after a somewhat drastic deterioration of her memory. We were starting to notice changes over the last 6 to 9 months, however, in June she was unable to recognize my father while out to dinner for their 54th wedding anniversary. 

On top of that, I had to put our family dog to sleep three weeks ago because of heart failure. My mother considered our little Chihuahua her fourth child. Given her diagnosis she is constantly looking for Lacey around the house and we are having to break the news to her that she passed away 3 to 4 times a day. I tried to tell her that we took her to get groomed once and she panicked because Lacey was always by her side. It is gut wrenching. Her cognitive functions are still good enough that I cannot substitute with a stuffed animal and the thought of getting another dog is just too overwhelming with everything on our plate right now. 

Does anyone had to deal with this before and how did you help ease the pain for your loved one?",1
"He was too young to die from this, he was in his mid-60s. He was only diagnosed in October 2019, and it has been a hard time since then. He went peacefully with myself and my husband by his side. I am glad he is finally free and at peace, but I miss my daddy. 

Fuck Alzheimer’s",1
"My mom is still in the early stages, but she has no short term memory. I have to go out of town for a couple of days next week, so I have been prepping her for this for days. Ex: “On Monday I have to go to \_\_\_\_\_. We put it one the calendar. *Opens refrigerator.*  Your lunches will be here. Dinners are here with heating instructions.” As I was doing this today (for about the 3rd time) my mom was looking at me like she was a little confused. I said, “Don’t worry, we will go over it again and I will write it down.”

She deadpanned, “Why? Are you afraid you are going to forget?”

Then she cackled.",1
"My dad got COVID and put in the hospital and got a UTI and bladder infection shortly after. They wouldn’t take him out of the hospital until after everything was cleared up and he was there for 2 weeks. They moved him to a nursing home to recover. 

He seemed fine at first. He was sleeping when mom got there on the 31st and she thought he was just tired from being transferred. We came back on the 3rd and they said he wasn’t eating much and he was still out of it. I got him to eat ice cream and a banana baby food and a protein shake and drink lots of water for lunch. Sunday mom said he was eating ham and potatoes and a pie and that he had ate 40% of breakfast.  We came back on Tuesday and he looked so awful 😞 and they said he wasn’t eating or drinking and that he was choking on everything. They kept saying they were gonna put him a purée diet but never did. I came on Wednesday and he said a few mumbles to me. I gave him some water but he was choking and pocketing it. he was there for a few minutes but then glazed out. I told my sis and bro to come the next day. He was asking for my sister. They came and they had hospice come. And hospice said they were gonna get a him on a purée diet and give him a better bed. And give him a catheter because hospice thought the bladder infection may had not completely resolved. He wasn’t really responsive. I had hoped he would recover a little with the purée diet.

I feel these nurses were so dumb. Mom was getting called into a meeting about his future care as he was dying. Hospice had literary taken over so I don’t know what the meeting was even supposed to be about. I screamed for her but I couldn’t leave him. She missed his last moments. 😞 

We were also told they had the wrong phone number on file and were calling a random lady. No idea how that happened, mom filed out the paperwork 

I feel so angry and sad. I feel they didn’t help my dad much and all the nurses were on different pages. The room was so loud and I requested dad to be moved to a quieter room. I asked so many times about the protein shakes and purée and I was told they noted it but it never changed. 

I know uti and bladders infections can really hurt people with dementia, but part of me feels the hospital and nursing didn’t care for my dad well. 😞😞 I feel he was neglected 

I feel so sad to lose my dad. He declined so rapidly. He was still talking and walking and eating before he had COVID",1
"I just really miss my dad. 

At first Alzheimer's felt like something to beat / 'to get on top of' but now it feels like all the energy has vanished & we're just left with sad reality. Dad is in moderate / advanced stages now but fortunately because of the way the illness has progressed the damage seems to have largely first impacted the parietal lobes and hippocampus. He still has a fantastic sense of humour. 

I just really miss him and I wonder whether I did the right thing in moving overseas for work. He can't use the phone anymore and I feel as though we've said our goodbyes even if I wasn't quite ready to do so.",1
"
Over the last two years my mother (74) has been declining mentally. She hasn’t received a formal diagnosis of Alzheimer’s, but has issues with memory. She no longer drives, and has decision making issues. My father (74) is attached to her at the hip 24/7. He gives her meds, reminds her to eat, to shower, etc. 

She keeps going to the neurologist and getting MRIs and they don’t find anything. However, she hasn’t received any cognitive testing. 

I love across the country and although I love my father and he’s a good man, I don’t know if he’s advocating for her properly. 

My problem is, I don’t know what to advocate for. I don’t know what kind of treatments / medications / therapies I should be asking about / researching. My sister is planning a conference call at their next appointment with the neurologist, but we just want to do as much as we can to advocate for her to get the right care. 

I’m probably rambling, but if anyone has any insights or advice from experience, I would be very grateful. 

Thank you very much",1
"Can someone please tell me how to handle my Mom's sadness? As in for me. Mom is in a Nursing Facility. She knows who I am and knows my husband as well. I can bring Mom out of her sadness. I am very good at comforting her. I comfort her as I would a baby. I'm very loving and I hug her and kiss her all the time. It's me that can't handle her sadness. It tears me apart! I never cry in front of her. I make it outside her door but usually make it to my truck. Sometimes I'm home and call her and make it til we hang up and then get in my truck and go to her. Out of everything... her not knowing where she is, going to see her grandmother, going to her Momma's funeral, etc. it's her sadness that tears me apart and I simply cannot handle it.

My dad was just diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's. He is 51 and has been driving from Florida to north Carolina once a week to watch my sister play college sports. On his trip this week he told her that he went to the doctor (this is a big deal he never goes to the doctor he would rather super glue or stitch his cuts himself than see a doctor) and they diagnosed him with early onset Alzheimer's. He told her not to tell anyone else. She told me because now she is worried about him driving all that way. He won't tell my mom and I'm guessing he won't tell me. I'm not sure if he is waiting until after my wedding in 2 weeks or if he is worried it might make him look weak or something. I'm not sure if I should just wait until after the wedding and see if he talks about it or if I should call him and tell him I know. Could he just need time to process it himself before he tells anyone who might try to help him? I don't know what to do and I'm worried about him.,1
Refuses to get out of bed all day. 6pm the queen dies. Instantly has to get up and watch TV.,1
"Hey guys, my grandma was recently diagnosed with early onset dementia/alzheimers. 

A strange thing started happening around the same time, where she suddenly started claiming to constantly feel the need to pee and would be back and forth to the bathroom literally every 15 minutes. This seems to worsen in the evening, and she would wake up and go to the bathroom 20 - 30 times during the night. My grandpa would have to get up each time and guide her back to bed.

The doctors thought she may have a UTI and have thrown a plethora of anti-biotics at it which did nothing. They put her on a low dose anti-psychotic which seemed to do the trick for a few weeks, but she's since relapsed into the same behavior. 

Obviously the lack of sleep would not be helping her cognition and could be making the problem worse. I mentioned this to my parents who were going to speak to her doctor about potentially giving her some form of sedative to force her to get some sleep and see if that improved the problem. And also allow my grandpa to get a full nights rest. 

At this point we're pretty much convinced it's psychological, and I was wondering if anyone else has ever encountered or heard of this in dementia patients? I also wonder if it's a side effect of the medications they've got her on",1
"I'm 17, and my dad has stage 6 Alzheimer's (I think, I'm in the dark here for reasons I will get into). I've never really had that close a relationship with my dad, especially leading up to when he started exhibiting symptoms. He was told he needed heart surgery, and in the year leading up to it, he was being a dick to everyone and had a short stint with alcoholism. After the surgery, the pandemic happened; bad. Around December 2020, he went to live with his parents (in their 80s) because I couldn't stand to be around him. That's where he remains. 

I was watching Truly Madly Deeply, and something clicked: my dad will die soon. I feel guilty for hating him, but I don't know how to stop. I don't know if our relationship can be mended. I don't know if I'm having a moment right now or if this crushing guilt will continue. He's already died once; now it's only a matter of time. 

Thank you for reading. I just needed to get this off of my chest.",1
"Sorry for just dropping in and asking but we are trying to make sense of my SIL's behaviour

She has been diagnosed with Early Onset Alzheimer's and is showing much of the forgetfulness that comes with this. She also exhibits the mood swings but one consistent issue is that she behaves in a contrarian way much more than she used to

For example if we are to point at a curtain and say ""that is a nice blue curtain"" she will immediately start looking **anywhere else** and say ""what are you talking about""

This never happens on the Jekyll end of the mood swing but is guaranteed on the Hyde end. To be clear she did behave like this for most of her life but only when she was being particularly bloody minded. Now it is almost the only thing on the Hyde end of a mood swing

The question is is this behaviour part of Alzheimer's or just how Alzheimer's is affecting her personality?",1
"In reading thru many posts here, among other symptoms, the ones I see that are common amongst many are: short term memory loss, what I’ll call imposter syndrome (their spouse is not their spouse - LO, SO, etc), aggression, hallucinations, people coming and going thru their homes. I’ve experienced these with my SIL when I was with her. I’ve seen mention of loss of executive function which I guess control these. I know nobody can answer this now so just throwing it out there. Why wouldn’t it effect, first, mobility, or other physical abilities? This f’ing disease seems to strike the same way in most everybody . I just often wonder if they are searching for reasons in the wrong place. Remember that ulcers used to be caused from stress and excess stomach acid ….",1
"This will be extremely hard... As I’ve mentioned in this sub before, this will be my first time ever experiencing the death of a precious loved one. Other deaths I’ve had in my extended family were people I barely knew, and of course it was still sad, but this is going to be—and already is—an advanced level of sadness. Grief, as they call it. He and my grandma helped raise me and so we were very close. He was put on hospice a few days ago. He is not eating. He is not drinking. This is it. The most amazing grandpa you could ever imagine, and he’s about to go…I know it’s just a natural, inevitable part of life, but…I feel cheated, as though I didn’t even get to spend his last years with him (even though I technically did. I was there for him and my grandma) because the dementia turned him into a different person. I still loved him dearly, and I still cherish those visits with him - as emotionally difficult as they were, and even though he was very confused and non-verbal for most of it-

I also feel so bad for my grandma... I’m going to visit her often! I love both of them so immensely. Thank you so much for reading.",1
"my grandparents live in a foreign country, and since childhood i’ve been able to go once a year to visit. since covid, it’s been a. while since i last saw them. I’m visiting them right now. my grandfather had always cared for me a lot, i was his first & favourite grandchild. we were very close. everyone recalls how we were inseperable, i know he loved me a lot.

recently he got what seems to be alzheimers. doctors here are unreliable but in short: he struggles to remember people he doesn’t see often, he sleeps all day, soils his trousers by accident, he doesn’t speak or eat much and is usually in a bad mood. my grandmother who is his sole caretaker laughs at his condition and treats him with less respect than most people - i don’t blame her for this because he borderline emotionally abused her for years and years and is still disrespectful to her when he does speak. but I still feel so bad for the grandfather i love.

he doesn’t remember my name, but he knows who i am. i try to talk to him in very simple, one word sentences sometimes - he only nods or sighs. i’ve hugged him three times, and saw a genuine smile. 

what do I do? how can I show him I love him? he’s very old so we all know he doesn’t have long left. I don’t want his last memory of me to be a bad one. I don’t want him to see me as compliant with his mistreatment.",1
"On our property there's 2 houses, a big house where I live with my parents, and a small house where my grandma lives.
Many years ago, when my grandpa was still alive, we decided that I'd go live in the small house after my grandparents pass or move to a nursing home, otherwise the house would have to be sold and nobody wanted that. I'm now almost 30 and have a boyfriend so ofcourse, I'd like to move out, but beyond talking about it to my boyfriend and mother, it's never really mentioned as I don't want to make my grandmother feel as if she needs to get out.
Though lately she's really picking on me about it.. her favorite TV show isn't on anymore? ""Pruts did it cause she wants me gone!"" Can't immediately find something? ""Pruts stole it so I couldn't do xyz anymore and I'd have to go to the nursing home"" I say that what she said isn't accurate? ""You're trying to make people think I'm crazy so they'd put me away and you can come live here""
Ugh. I've ignored it for months cause yeah sure grandma, she doesn't actually mean it like that right? Then the other day I was gardening and I heard her talking to herself in her kitchen.. ""they think I don't know but I know. The little one (me) always with her my house my house my house. Thinks I'm not onto her. She's not getting anything from me. Over my dead body that she'll ever live here"" I was really shocked honestly. I totally understand she doesn't want to leave her home but she's SO against me living there. Tbh I've been having a hard time dealing with my grandmother lately cause her alzheimer has been getting much worse and being around her as much is really rough, and since this happened I just.. I don't want to see or hear her. Part of me just wants to find an apartment to be away from all this and maybe ease her mind that I'm not just out to get her house but I'm not really able to rent an apartment for less than 5 years at a time and it seems like a huge waste of money considering I'll have to renovate her house and that'll be very expensive too. 

Additional info:
Shes not on any medication for alzheimers cause she already refuses to take her blood pressure meds and our doctor doesn't know how to make her take them.
Shes on a list for a nursing home, but the only way to get her actually in one is if she becomes unmanageable or if she ends up in hospital",1

I’m coming home to dog vomit and urine in my bed so I know that the dog is clearly not being paid attention to while I’m at work. My mother, although not physically disabled, just spends all day in bed in front of the tv. She stopped taking the dog on walks a long time ago. Re-homing the dog is not an option.

I guess I could not be on my phone, but one of the only thing Grandpa can do is watch shows and listen to radio on the porch. I have watched and rewatched a ton of game shows and westerns.",1
"I was at my fathers place two days ago and his girlfriend told me she thinks he has alzheimers. Here are the two things she noticed recently.
1) They travelled together to an interstate funeral. After the funeral she was talking about it and he asked “oh were you there too?”
2) she also told me that after they got back from a holiday recently it took him two weeks to relearn his own phone number.

Still in a bit of shock about this. As it sounds like it has gotten quite bad quite quickly. He’s always been pretty vague so I guess it’s taken me a while to notice. 
I guess I’m wondering how far along do you think he is based on that information?
What can I do to maybe “slow” the progress of the alzheimers? Is that even possible?
Should I talk to my dad about it or will that make it worse? 
Is there a book or a documentary I should read?

"Has anyone experienced their Loved One becoming incredibly anxious over urination and bowel movements? My Dad was dx with Alzheimer’s about 9 months ago but has had symptoms for at least 6 years (that is another story for another day dealing with my mother’s denial, etc etc). In the last few months, his anxiety has increased exponentially and it all surrounds his fear of not getting to a toilet in time to urinate or fear of constipation. He has never leaked nor is he constipated (one to two bowel movements a day). My mom has him wear briefs for security but, as I said, he has never had an accident.

This fear is paralyzing and has rendered him basically home bound.  Any suggestions/experience with this issue?!?",1

She called me sobbing and I told her to just come over to my house as she had not written the check but the man was going back to his house to get the meat and a free freezer. I had to go stake out the house for an hour and wait for him.  My in-laws came to help and we told the man she was no longer interested and that he was to leave.  Has anyone else dealt with this?  My dad is so friendly and doesn't know who anyone is but my mom is friendly to people that she hires to do things around the house (mower and neighbors), so he probably just thinks people are stopping by.  I'm very concerned about this but not sure how to handle it other than having my mom try to keep him confined in the house.

"My Dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s this past April. I knew it was coming, my whole family did. I have a really complicated relationship with my dad. He was really emotionally neglectful and I have a lot of resentment towards him for how I grew up. My dad and I are not close, we don’t talk much and don’t see each other often even though we live in the same town. He doesn’t value relationships and doesn’t have any friends. His mom is 98 and in a care home. 

His short term memory is terrible. He can’t manage his finances anymore. To make this all worse, him and my mom are currently separating. That was a long time coming and isn’t because of his diagnosis. So now he’s living alone, and he’s started drinking regularly as well. 

His lawyer doesn’t feel he’s comprehending what’s going on and so I’ll be attending his appointments and will be doing the POA process as well. This whole thing has put me in such a weird emotional state, I don’t know what to expect. I know he’ll slip away eventually. My parents were older as well so I’m going through this at 31. I don’t know what to expect. 

Not even sure what the point of this is. I’ve just been crying a lot about this and don’t have anyone in my life to relate to. Im scared for what’s going to happen. My dad is alone.",1

"My dad has been showing signs of cognitive decline for some years. He’s not officially diagnosed (I think what he’s diagnosed with isn’t quite right, but that’s a whole other story).

He has an iPhone to stay in touch with us and other family members but he seems to struggle with using it properly. He’ll do things like blast the same messages/images/links to dozens of contacts on different group chats, several messaging apps, multiple emails, etc. He’s even created maybe 5 of his own FB accounts (that many because each time he forgets his login, he creates a new one) and tries to message different people and businesses on his feed because he thinks they are sending him messages. That’s all annoying but fairly harmless. However, recently it’s gotten to the point where he’ll blast my private contact information over the internet for people to see and he’s not understanding what he’s doing wrong. 

Is there some kind of app (like what they have for kids) I can use or some kind of way I can set up his phone to limit what he can do / to simplify the functions on his phone. He still believes he’s perfectly fine and he’ll get mad and probably go buy his own new phone if we did anything like confiscate the current one. I’m really at a lost as to where to start. Any advice?",1
"Hi all,

I will preface this with the fact that my dad (73 y/o) does not actually have Alzheimer’s, but recently has significant short term memory loss due to years of untreated sleep apnea. My apologies, I could not find a relevant subreddit related to resources for memory loss (feel free to direct me, thank you).

My dad has started experiencing memory issues in the form of not remembering whether he ate, took his medication, his plans for the evening, and he constantly misplaces and loses things. It is frustrating for him, and as he’s generally the “fixer” of things around the house and at rental properties and what not, he feels “useless” (his words) since he does these things much less now because he keeps forgetting tools, can’t remember what he was doing, etc. It’s the first time I’ve heard him speak poorly about himself and what he brings to our family and it’s sad to see.

I’m wondering if in your experience, there might be something you can recommend that my dad can sort of work on to make him feel accomplished, helpful to our family, and generally a useful person. This is very important for him so I would be very grateful.",1
"I went to visit my grandma the other day and she was in great spirits! She was playing with her toy dog and we were singing along to some of her favorite songs, “somewhere over the rainbow” and “what a wonderful world.” Towards the end of the evening she got really anxious and didn’t recognize my me, my sister, and my mom (her daughter). She looked at me and said “can I ask who you are?” I don’t think she has been able to recognize us for a while now but this is the first time she has said something like that. It’s really heartbreaking when someone you love and looked up to can’t figure out who you are. I’m also having a lot of difficultly remembering what her personality used to be like before her diagnosis which is really sad. I love my grandma and it sucks seeing her this way",1
"My husband was diagnosed with early stage Alzheimer in January and has been stable and independent until this week, when I noticed a sudden Alzheimer worsening. We figured out that he has covid, and that that was the trigger. On Thursday he seemed to be back to his old self, but yesterday afternoon his confusion got through the roof again.
His COVID symptoms are improving. But his clarity is not. 
He keeps coming out of his room (including 1:20am!), as soon as I tell him that he needs to stay in the room he goes back, to come out later again.

He clearly cannot be left alone at home for now - before COVID he was totally independent, and only needed assistance with the agenda.

There is not much I can do because he has COVID.

I know that there is some chance of him regaining some clarity once the I’ll esa heals, but what if he doesn’t??
Has anyone here had a Alzheimer-COVID experience?

I cannot afford to quit my job, and we cannot afford an assisted living place. Do you hire a companion?
Thanks,",1
"Anger, sadness, pain, it’s all welling up inside me and taking every ounce of self control to not yell and throw things. Her forgetting going places, relentless hoarding when trying to move, reckless financial decisions that I’m powerless to stop as I’m the youngest and she is still lucid, accusing me of being angry at her and to “stop doing this” to her when really all of my opinions offend her and I want to avoid an argument. She will seriously start a negative exchange and then say that I’m the one that is causing the hurt. I just can’t do it guys, I’m bursting at the seams. What the heck do I do? It doesn’t help that I’m 25 and my father died when I was young. :/ 

Please help. I feel so alone.",1
"I’ve been working as a caregiver for my grandmother since the start of the summer. I was working 7 days a week typically anywhere from 6-20hrs a day. The most hours I spent with her in a week was 96hr. We’ve been using a caregiving service but they have a very high turnover rate (which explains my random hours). 

Last Thursday that changed because (under the suggestion of my grandmothers doctors and nurses) we brought her to the ER. We were waitlisted to get her into a home and day to day care was getting to be very difficult. She wasn’t taking her pills, that constant cycle of people was stressing her out, she didn’t want anyone to change her pamper, etc. This Monday we were told that they found a home for her, so it’s working out.

My father has been visiting her in the hospital about everyday, I’ve only gone with him twice. It’s obvious to me that he’s getting frustrated with me that I’m not visiting my grandmother as often as him. But I feel no need too nor do I want to atm. My reasoning is 1) I’m mentally exhausted and would like a break from her. 2) now that’s she’s in the hospital she’s been getting many relatives visiting her 3) the two times that I’ve gone, while she does look happy to see us, she refocuses on watch tv and then me and my father sit on our phones. And then when we leave she gets confused and frustrated that we are not taking her with us. My dad finds this confusion cute but I disagree.

My dad came into my room today and told me to spend an hour with my grandmother today. And to iron her clothes so that they look nice for when she goes to the home. I really wanted to say “no” but I ended up asking “why?” And he said “what do you mean ‘why’? She’s your grandmother.” And then he laughed to himself and left for work.

He never cares how I feel and is always making me out to be the bad guy. Growing up I had a strained relationship with my grandmother. The first time I looked after my grandmother, I had been pressured into it because my father want to go on a date. She ended up falling down and I wasn’t able to get her to get her up (narrow hallway, they left while she was in the bathroom taking a shower). She was laying on the floor for an hour before my father got home and was able to help her up. 

The second time was last winter, I was nervous because of the first incident but I was also trying to take my finals. He kept telling me that it was easy and that all I had to do was cook for her. (I also had to stay with her for a full two weeks because this was before the caregiving service). On the night before one of my exams she hit me with a picture frame and started yelling at me that she wanted to do Laundry (she was going through a phase that she wanted to do laundry every day). It took hours to calm her down and then I ended up oversleeping and missing my exam. I didn’t want to take care of her after that but then my dad‘s girlfriend started crying that I was so cruel. 

During this summer my dad also pressured me to taking care of my grandmother because of how wishy-washy our caregiving service is, but I’ve been able to disconnect my emotions from how she’s acting now and how I’ve perceived her as a child. Our relationship has never been better but she just doesn’t know who I am half the time. 

It’s also so frustrating that he can come and treat me like I’m some uncaring party and then when he interacts with my grandmother he just doesn’t understand what’s going on with her. Whenever she’s showing symptoms of sundowners he’s like convinced that she’s like playing some mind game with us. Whenever she shows symptoms of pain he’s convinced that she’s lying because she can’t tell us where the pain is coming from. I know that sometimes she’ll pretend to be asleep to get out of taking pills but that’s really as far as it goes.",1
"UTIs seem to be a thing for dad. I guess between all the meds and refusing to ever drink anything except coffee, I can see how that happens. 

This time around he’s complaining of severe dizziness, and used the word vertigo to describe it. 

He started antibiotics last night, so I’m hopeful they’ll start working soon. Has anyone else dealt with that dizziness symptom? Just curious if anyone has more information.

Thanks.",1
Is it common for people in the early stages to have selective memory? My dad forgets most of petty recent events but he'd remember every detail about the argument he had with his girlfriend last night. Or he forgets what are my work timings but remembers everything about the afternoon he spent with my son yesterday. There are many other examples where he barely remembers things that don't matter to him much and remembers every detail about recent events/conversations that do matter. He is not officially diagnosed but je has been showing signs.,1
"My mom (72) has started showing signs of cognitive decline in the last 6-8 months or so. Most of the time she seems normal but definitely gets into funks from time to time where it’s noticeable. Her mother, my grandmother, had dementia in the last few years of her life (she lived to be 93) but this is much sooner so it has us worried. My grandmother had siblings that did have full blown Alzheimer’s but I don’t know any more detail than that. 

So onto today’s dilemma. My dad texted me to call him asap because mom thinks it’s Wednesday morning and is trying to eat breakfast. It’s in fact Tuesday at 5:30pm. She had just gotten up from a nap and was really slow to snap out of it. Even on the phone just now I could tell she was still trying to get her bearings. 

She did say that she couldn’t sleep last night which is why she went to lie down. But this is very out of character for her. She does not nap. Ever. Not even when she had Covid. She also didn’t have any idea how long she was out and really believed it was morning. 

My dad is freaked out and so is my mom because he made her think she’s losing it. Which might be true but I don’t know if that was the right way to approach this. How big of a deal is this? Does she need to be seen by a doctor asap? I don’t know if she’ll even go but I might be able to talk her into it. 
Any advice is appreciated!",1
"My father was moved from Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's about a month ago. We're still working on the conservatorship thing, and also finding an IHSS caregiver to come in. I was out of town this weekend and had made arrangements for people to look in on him while I was gone. I was driving home today to help celebrate his 77th birthday and I get a call from his friend who was going to take him out that they'd lost their car keys and couldn't make it here (from a couple hours away) to take him out and check on him. I called my dad in the few miles I had reception while driving through the mountains home to let him know I was on my way and his friend wouldn't be taking him out to dinner but I would and he was in the process of having a HUGE panic attack. 

He claimed someone had told him he had brain cancer. He couldn't tell me who, he couldn't tell me when, and he couldn't tell me how they'd told him. I assured him repeatedly that he DIDN'T have brain cancer and that he only has Alzheimer's (which he said he already knew) but he started saying that he knows he has brain cancer because ""they"" told  him. He then started saying he was going to go kill himself because he couldn't go through that. I kept assuring him and said I was coming home and we were going to celebrate his birthday. I was able to watch on our indoor security cameras that he was still very agitated and pacing when we'd hung up and decided I should call in a wellness check as I was still two hours away. Our fire department came out, checked on him, said he was coherent, cool, calm, and collected and asked if I'd like him taken to the ER. I said no and thanked them profusely for checking on him. 

By the time the fire department had gotten there, he'd COMPLETELY forgotten that he had ""brain cancer"" and only wanted to talk about how hot the fire men were (out of character?!) Our entire birthday dinner was him talking about the firemen and our family history in Croatia. 

This was an entirely made up scenario. He's been getting birthday calls all day from family and friends and I can pinpoint who he talked to and whatnot from our indoor security cameras. Everyone he spoke to said he was chipper and whatnot. When I called, he was in a complete panic. He was slamming his hands against the wall, visibly shaking, etc. He hadn't been watching TV or listening to anything so I don't know what might have influenced it.

It's crossing a new realm to have called in a wellness check. I start work tomorrow after the entire summer off, and while we've been getting IHSS settled all summer, we still don't have someone to look in on him during the day and I'll be a little over an hour away for the school day. I am very scared for what this will mean now.",1
"EDIT: I wanna thank everyone for their advice and opinions. I’m going to be mailing her a letter along with her mirrors. I appreciate people telling me to let it be, and I think those suggestions are best. He is a healthy bird, and she’s 94. I shouldn’t have worried so much about him living with some potentially bad toys for awhile. 


Although the situation is very specific, I have a feeling that the principal of it is fairly common. My great grandmother has dementia, but she is capable of living on her own, with visits from a nurse and my grandma, and she even has a pet bird. I recently watched her parrot for a couple weeks and I removed the mirrors from his cage. Mirrors can  cause hormonal and psychological confusion for birds, which can make them aggressive, secluded, and socially stunted. I sent him back without these mirrors and she has become fixated on getting them back. At first it was her simply asking about them once she noticed they were missing, but now she has started to war dial my mother and grandmother demanding them back. She’s become angry and won’t let it go. My mom is at her whits end, and explaining it to my great grandma goes nowhere- as it does for most dementia patients. I have a few ideas for how to remedy this situation, but I have no clue if they will work.

TLDR; my great grandmother is demented and fixated on getting her mirrors back to use as bird toys, but they’re bad for his well-being. She has started to become aggressive about getting them back. 

I mentioned that I had some ideas on how to approach this, I’ll go ahead and list those here: 

-	put stickers over the mirrors to keep the parrot from seeing himself while allowing her to have them in his cage (my concern with this is she might remove the stickers) 
-	sending her the mirrors as a “gift” for her use only. I’d attach a letter thanking her for letting me borrow them and suggest her ways to use them too. (I’m not sure this would work because she’s still fairly able-minded) 

That’s really all I could come up with in regards to a solution. Unfortunately I don’t have a ton of experience when it comes to redirection and dementia. Any advice is encouraged, and questions are welcome!",1
"hi everyone, i’m aware that this is a rather common part of alzheimer’s but i really don’t know how best to deal with it. 
my grandmother has been suffering with alzheimer’s for a while now, and she now is convinced that the house she’s living in (and has been living in for a while) isn’t hers. as of now she’ll still believe us when we tell her that it is her house but lately she’s been more insistent that its someone else’s and they’re just house sitting. she’ll say things like “we ought to pick up a nice bottle of wine as a thank you for the owners of the house we’re staying at” and “these floors will need a proper scrub when we leave here so they come back to a clean house”. 
what’s the best response to this kind of thinking? i’m really unsure how best to respond to her when she says these kinds of things and asks these kinds of questions.",1
"What do you do with aggressive behaviour?
When my mother becomes aggressive (which lately tends to be on a daily basis) it is very hard to handle. She insults, beats and it's impossible to calm her. I am literally in desperation.

How do you handle it?
Any recommendations about medicines that help?",1
"My uncle was diagnosed with mid-stage Alzheimer’s, and we’re struggling to provide the care he needs. He’s still physically fit, so he gets aggressive at times, and also does things that put himself and his family in danger. Some examples are him sneaking out of his bedroom window because he wanted to get yogurt, and walking several kilometers to a stranger’s house to get it, pulling the hand brake while in the passenger’s seat because he believed my mom was going the wrong way, and more.

He still remembers us for the most part, and even though he suffers from many delusions, he can at times talk in a very reasonable way. We found a lovely care home where he will be able to get a lot of physical activity, while also receiving the 24/7 care that we can’t provide at home. However we don’t know how to take him there.

We can’t get his consent, because he doesn’t believe there’s anything he needs help with. Anything he loses or forgets, he blames on his dad (who passed away over 10 years ago). We don’t want to forcefully put him there, or trick him and leave him, but we don’t know what we can do. His doctors haven’t been helpful, saying the part after the diagnosis is the family’s responsibility, and we have limited resources in my country. We know that the care home would be good for him, but we don’t know how to get him to go in a way that isn’t traumatic. I would appreciate any and all help and advice, my best wishes to everyone who may be going through this.",1
"TYIA. I'm hoping to find out if anyone else has had experience with these meds causing uncontrolled bowel movements—and if so, whether the side effect continued, and whether there was any change with administration by patch, rather than oral tablet. 

My partner (62F, roughly stage 5, properly Dx'd with Alz) had neurologist Rx Donepezil. Barely got through up-titration dose of 1 week 5mg before she began experiencing messy daily poops; continued with a few days at 10 mg, more poops. Stopped the med.

Switched to Galantamine. After 5 days at beginner dose 8 mg, poops started up again. Stopped the med. I'll spare you the details, but let's say I worried about dehydration with the frequency, volume, texture. (Not to mention the ""cleanup on aisle 5"" issues.) She had two falls during the period we assayed those meds; unsure whether related or not. 

Her neuro wants to try a patch for (I think) Galantamine, hoping to mitigate the side effect. 

I was wondering if (a) anyone was able to ride out this side effect, seeing decrease in poop problems after the body adjusted; and (b) whether a transdermal patch was effective at curbing side effect. And has anyone had success with, say, probiotics or other ways of addressing the issue?

I know any comments will be anecdotal, not a substitute for medical advice. I also know that it's hard to discern whether this class of meds is ""working,"" as slowing Alz progression is difficult to gauge. Just asking about the poops.",1
"My mother is 74 and recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's by her primary care physician who gave her tests and she had an MRI I believe. 

I've never been close to my parents growing up...no family arguments or anything it was just life. My father died 2 yrs ago. Before his death, I had noticed a decline in my mom's memory; after his death it became increasingly worse. My mom stayed in her home until Feb 2022. She was increasingly depressed and her Dr adjusted her antidepressants and anxiety meds. It got to a point where she was constantly calling me upset and crying because she was lonely, got lost driving, couldn't remember things etc. We moved her into a senior apartment complex thinking it would be good for her socially, give her some peace. Until then she had literally never lived on her own and had absolutely no idea of what to do, how to do things etc. She always had my dad who took care of everything and told her what she needed to do.

On June 1st she wandered away from the apartment and was found at a nearby nursing home with no clue about where she was, how she got there, where she was trying to go and did not remember she lived in an apartment. She's been living with me since.

It's been 2 mos and I find myself getting increasingly irritated and annoyed. I know none of this is her fault but it's so tiring answering the same questions over and over and over, explaining the same things over and over and listening to her worry about every little thing. We have a puppy and 3 cats and she has 1 cat. She nitpicks over everything, gets annoyed with the puppy (when I'm already annoyed with him lol), when dinner is done, she won't eat until I do, when at the store, she is right on top of me like a 2 yr old. She constantly apologizes and feels like she's a burden which makes me feel like crap.

She constantly says she wants to go to a nursing home. I looked into assisted living but we can't afford private pay and she has too much in assets to apply for Medicaid. She has a decent amount of money in savings, checking and her retirement. I refuse to spend all of that down...she worked 30+ years for that while my dad raised me and my brother. My dad was a hoarder and my childhood home is a disaster. It is going to take a significant length of time to clean it out and make all repairs needed to make it habitable. We have no intention of selling, instead, I'm going to have her transfer it to me and I'm going to keep it for my daughter once we can get it ready or for my youngest son. 

I am already stressed out over the situation in addition to working from home at a very stressful job and wanting to end my marriage. I don't know what to do. I know having her live here is best for her...she will not engage in social activities but wants to be with me and my family while also wanting to ""be put somewhere."" I feel like my life is literally over and this disease is what I have to look forward to. 

Sorry for the ramble and the vent. I feel guilty, selfish, resentful and have no idea where to go from here.",1
"I'm having a difficult time living with my grandmother who has severe Alzheimer's and she has hearing loss(but with hearing aid). Her actions are based on habit and there are some really bad habits that she has.  She likes to lift the strainer in the bathroom and dump garbage down the sink. It's pretty costly. 

I've tried to label the sink. I've reminded her on multiple occasions by bringing her into the bathroom and teaching her about the sink. But it just doesn't sink in. She just dumps all her garbage down the sink. There are other problems but I would say this is the most important one.",1
"
Just posting this bc I need to vent, and because I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. As a lot of you probably know, it’s so hard to get anyone, even your closest friends, to understand no matter how hard they try. 

My mom started showing signs 4-5 years ago, and these past 2 years her disease has rapidly progressed. I’m 22 now, and shes only 56. 

I’ve been away at college and have only recently come home after graduating. I’ve been home on holidays and summers, but each time I come home she’s exponentially worse. When I got home a few months ago, I found out that she’s unable to use the bathroom by herself now. She wears a diaper but often has issues going number 2, and will get poop everywhere (on the toilet seat, floor, etc.) because she’s confused. She used to be really aggressive and upset and have episodes where she’s absolutely hysterical and unable to be consoled, but that has passed. It looks like she needs to be placed in a memory care facility soon, but it’s just incredibly expensive. 

My dad is the primary caretaker, and the guilt I’ve felt since leaving for college is more than I can handle.  He’s extremely unhappy, and takes his frustrations out on me or her. Nothing physical, just harsh words and raised voices. I resent him, but I also respect him so much for everything he’s done for me and my family. He’s supported me financially for forever -which is another guilt I have to carry. 

Im constantly sad nowadays, and I don’t recognize myself. It’s hard to get out of bed most days, or get myself to do anything besides go to the gym. I miss my mom so much, and knowing that at this rate, she won’t be there for my wedding, meet my children, or any other major milestone in my life is such a deep hurt that I don’t wish upon anyone on this earth. When I think back to before her disease, I can barely remember her. I was a dumb teenager who only wanted to be with my friends, and never got to know my mom outside of a mother daughter dynamic. I just wish we had more time.

I find myself having suicidal thoughts often, but I would never do anything even close to that because of the extra burden it would place on my dad. I know I need to see a therapist, but I don’t even know where to start with that. I’m moving to a new city soon to start a new job, but I just don’t know how my life can start with my dad miserable at home and my mom in the state that she’s in. 

If you read all of this, thank you- and I hope you’re doing ok ❤️",1
"He has been showing signs for the last 18 months. Current age 69 years and 2 months to be exact. I recently shared our struggle in making him go see a neurologist so officially he isn't diagnosed but he definitely has it. I will share some of his symptoms and based on your experience, you can decide if it is early stages or mid.

The good:
Exercises daily, eats well, still has the sense of humour, can carry a conversation on any topic, current affairs, cars, sports etc. Past memory is perfect. If you are seeing him for the first time, there is no way you can tell he has a problem.

The bad:
Sometimes repeats a question or a story. Misplaces things. Remembering recent events is a hit and a miss. He might remember that I took him for a coffee in the morning but he might not remember what he had for lunch 3 hours ago. Same with time. For example, I talked to him today after three days and he remembered that it had been three days. On other occasions, it could be two days and he'd think it has been 5 days.

The ugly:
He is having one hell of a hard time processing new information. For someone who was an engineer with a solid math. background, he struggles with simple numbers. Be it money, taxes or anything where a bit of thinking is required. He eventually gets it but it takes a while.

So he is all over the place. I can't decide between mild and moderate AD. What do you guys think?",1
"My grandmother had some kind of dementia/Alzheimer's. She never got diagnosed but we saw things ranging from her accusing me of stealing her cigarettes (when in reality she has been hiding them from herself in her dressers), to not being physically able to clothe herself, to her and I having full length conversations with her thinking I was my mother (I'm male with a not-so-subtle amount of facial hair). She eventually died of a heart attack after a hospital stay, due to wandering outside during a thunderstorm at night and breaking her hip, not to be found until the next morning.

So I've kind of been on watch for 20 years or so, and I'm fairly certain that time is quickly approaching. My mom has always been a pretty clean person in both hygiene and environmentally. But she no longer showers daily (a few times a week at best), she's started forgetting to use the bathroom and if she does she doesn't flush, and there's been some minor trash hoarding going on. The first conversational memory thing I noticed was that she forgot my wife, my son, and I had all gotten COVID during Texas' big winter storm last year.

So I called the Alzheimer's Association to see what to do next and they suggested I get her diagnosed, first. After talking to her for an hour and a half about it, she's finally agreed to, albeit begrudgingly. She threw a ton of stuff in my face and has tried to guilt trip me (then deny it was meant to be a guilt trip), but we're here now. There's nothing more I can do until after Friday. But this was definitely the hardest conversation I've had to have with her in *years*, and I'm not looking forward to more of this",1

Can someone give advice?",1
"My mid-60s mom (diagnosed Alzheimers) cannot escape her desire to go walking.  Almost doesn't matter if it's day or night, every single day is nonstop begging and pleading to go walking.  If it's not walking, it's finding an excuse to take something outside for some reason.  It seems like an all-consuming compulsion to just ""not be in the house.""

The problem is not that she gets lost, she never gets lost, she has very specific routes in an easy (midwest country roads) square.  The problem is that she has no judgement of how much is too much or when to stop.  She is impervious to pain and will walk until her feet are bruised black and blue.  She was in an ankle brace for a while once and still begged to go walking.  She pays no attention to the weather even if it's 90 degrees F and would risk heat stroke.

All day, every day now:

* ""But why can't I walk?  It's a nice day out!""
* ""I just keep thinking it won't be a big deal, it'd be a quick trip, quick trip...""
* ""I just like picking up the trash at the side of the road!""
* ""I'll just go down to the school and back!"" (she won't)
* (holds up a tiny piece of napkin she dug out of the trash) ""I'm just taking this out to the recyclables.""
* ""I thought I saw something funny outside, I just want to check.""
* ""Someone slowed down out by the road, I want to make sure everything's ok.""
* ""But maybe the mail came, I need to check for the mail!"" (it's way too early)
* ""But maybe you'll let me go later?"" (repeated every 5 minutes)
* ""Well maybe I'll sneak out on my own!"" (we have an interior lock)

Distractions do not work.  She has a 100% 1-track mind, and even if you do distract her briefly with anything like doing the dishes, it's ""so I can walk as soon as I'm done with this?""  And doing a terrible quick job at it just so she can go walk.

She can't or won't do anything else.  She won't watch TV or read books.  Puzzles or games are immediately overwhelming.  She's not interested in conversation changing the subject, it will come back to walking within 5 minutes.

The problem is less the walking and more the pleading and the absolute insanity it drives us caregivers and my poor dad into.  It is incessant and never stops.  When she gets to walk it's because whoever is watching her has met their limit and gives in.  We have almost as much of an overwhelming desire to do anything for a moment's peace.  If we were to hire someone to help take care of her, their primary job would be to sit in front of her and say ""no you can't walk"" all day.

I've thought maybe it's some kind of restless leg syndrome...she denies that anything hurts or feels uncomfortable.  Even if it was, I'm not sure if there would be any way to tell, because she's seemingly lost the ability to let people know about pain or discomfort.  I feel like if she lost an arm she'd just act confused that she can't pick stuff up anymore.

"Is this a thing? How would I go about looking for someone to spend some time and watch after my mother in addition to me? What does something like this cost?

It's gotten to the point where I can't even leave the house without my mom feeling afraid of being alone, at any time of day. 

I feel selfish but god, I'm young, I still want to have my life, to go out to the gym or for a date but I can't leave without feeling guilty about the anxiety she's feeling. She starts locking all the windows for fear someone might come in while she's alone, luckily she just stays in the house and watches TV or calls her friends.",1
I’m not sure if anyone has heard of this but recently my grandmother has begun spraying ammonia in the room where i sleep. I haven’t caught her red handed but all the signs are there. She basically admitted it to me without admitting it. I want to know is sudden stark evilness a symptom of this disease? She’s been an evil woman but not like this.. this is a new level.,1
"For a little bit of context, my father was diagnosed with a form of Alzheimer's about 14 months ago. It is a rare form of Alzheimer's called Posterior Cortical Atrophy at 66. He was diagnosed about 2 years after a 6 month treatment cycle for cancer within his mouth and they believe the radiation expedited the onset of his Alzheimer's.

I am 25 and just graduated college and live about 1,000 miles from my parents and youngest sister (15). Recently my father has been extremely agitated towards my mother and younger sister. Specifically about driving and wanting to work a job again. We do not know what to do and can't get him into a specialists anytime soon. When we tell him he can't drive he becomes extremely upset and yells at whoever is telling him this and says ""you don't understand what you are taking from me"" as cars are probably his favorite hobby. When it comes to work he also gets upset and tells us we cannot tell him what to do and he can do whatever he wants and that it is his choice. I, along with my family, just don't know what to do anymore. He believes nothing is wrong with him and that the doctor has misdiagnosed him. But, we all know he is not right. He has frequent short term memory loss, and struggles to get home when going for bike rides or walks around a small town (\~2000 people) and my mom has been contacted before while at work that he seemed lost and she has gone to pick him up. He ends up saying he was just walking around or the reason he got lost is because he didn't have his GPS with him. Nobody is home with him 5 days during the week, luckily there is no car there either, but he also just seems depressed as of recent because we are taking away the things he loves to do (cars and working). I don't know how me or my older sibling can help as we both live far away from them. 

I recently got a job that is 100% travel but during down times I will be home. Do I move back to where my parents live, or in with them, to help my mom out and keep my dad company? Unfortunately my parents aren't at a point in their lives where my mom can retire as well. Sorry if this seems like a jumbled mess I just don't know what to do or where to start when trying to help him. Thanks for any advice given.",1
"My dad is 69, for the past year or so, he has been showing signs of dementia. He has his good days where everything seems normal but on other days he repeats things twice, sometimes three times. Asks the same question twice, repeats a story,  but more importantly has trouble processing new information. He gets it eventually but it takes him a while. He was really sharp 4-5 years ago.

He has always been reluctant to see a doctor. So far he has had good health, walks 7-8km everyday. We did the bloodwork the other day and it was normal but whenever we talk about a visit to a neurologist he loses it and says there is nothing wrong with him. I took his cognitive test (MoCA) and he didn't remember any of the five words I asked him to remember in the beginning. He did well in other questions like drawing a clock , count backwards by 7 from 100 etc. Now I know eventually I have to take him to a neurologist but what little I told you guys, could it be MCI and not dementia? or perhaps just old age?",1
"My father relinquished his license years before his diagnosis when his car was totaled and he didn't have the money to replace it. The problem now is that he rides his bike everywhere and it's something that is REALLY important to him and his doctors (both neurologist and GP) encourage it for his health. My concern now is that he will cause an accident on his bike and I will be left liable for the damages. 

I am his caregiver but don't have POA or conservatorship at this point but my attorney advised that I can still be held accountable for things that happen to him. In searching ""Alzheimer's, Crash, Liability"" it says that the care givers of the person with Alzheimer's can be held liable in a CAR crash but since, in CA, a bike is still considered a vehicle that has to follow road laws, is there a risk to me that I am going to be liable if/when there's a crash?

I can't legally keep him contained in the house and I can't follow him around constantly as I have to go to work and am gone for hours a day without the IHSS coverage to watch him. Yes, I know this is a question for the attorney but at $400 an hour and 10+ weeks scheduled out, I am more and more concerned at this. It's very much one of those situations where, until a doctor issues that he needs 24 hour care and some sort of medi-care coverage kicks in, there won't be care for him to keep him inside all the time and the reality of him causing a crash is very much a possibility.",1
"Hello to give some background on my dad he is 56 years old and from I can tell he started showing signs in 2020/2019. 

He has become extremely forgetful with just about everything. He seems to remember nothing I tell him. He frequently takes naps and asks me what day it is every time he wakes up. For example he’ll wake up and ask what time it is and I’ll tell him it’s Wednesday and he’ll say oh I thought it was Thursday. He’ll fall back asleep wake up 1 hour later and do the same thing except he thinks it’s Sunday or some other day.

He’s also become combative and argumentative with everything. It seems that he just argues with me for the sake of arguing instead of trying to come to some sort of agreement on basic things. 

One night I came home from work and the entire apartment we lived in was filled with smoke. He was trying to cook Mac and cheese but completely burned the entire pot black. When I found him he said he couldn’t walk and his knees were just collapsing/shaking. 

He has frequent nightmares where he says he wakes up crying and scared.

Some days he’s super nice and his normal self and other times he can seem almost untrusting of me despite nothing being wrong. 

He works night shifts and usually spends his entire weekend sleeping/ in bed watching movies. 

I’ve tried to bring it up with him but he insists nothing is wrong and I’m just being a neurotic jerk to him.

I would love to have his doctor evaluate him at the very least but I can’t convince him to do it.",1
My mother is in an independent living facility. She's been diagnosed with Alz but has not yet progressed to needed assisted care. Her big problem is UTI. She gets them all the time. We've tried talking to her about having to change her pads or depends but nothing seems to work. A nurse talked to her about how important it is but it was no help.  Has anyone had any success stories to share?,1
"So my spouse has late stage Alzheimer's, can still walk and eat, but makes no sense, cannot carry out a one-step instruction, and gets angry and abusive particularly with sundowning.  Tonight I no sooner got his excrement cleaned off a living room chair, than I find he has peed in my nightgown drawer.  Those WERE clean nightgowns and lingerie but they aren't any more.  He also pees in wastebaskets, laundry baskets, and the floor of the laundry room.  (Yes, I do have him in disposable briefs but he takes particular satisfaction on getting out of them.)

I realized last night that I don't love this man any more.  I loved who he was once, but all I feel now is disgust.  He helped himself to an orange tonight, ate the peel as well as the pulp, and spit seeds out all over the living room.  I point out that when he does that it makes extra work for me, he doesn't care and goes right on doing it.

I will soon be getting extra in-home help from a managed care organization and sending him to adult day care, which at least will give me a little more time to myself and to clean up after him.  I hope to have a move to memory care before another month or two.  I haven't taken my own medication in two full days because I am too busy cleaning up after him to sort out my pills (but his get done on time, every time).  

I look at old pictures of him and think what a handsome, charming man he once was.  Some will say he's still in there, but I don't even care any more.

Please don't advise that I should put my own oxygen mask on first.  Already know that.  Can't be bothered.  This is beyond burnout, this is hatred and disgust, and I don't even feel bad admitting it.",1
"Grandma is in her early 80s. She has had alzheimers since around 2018. For the past few weeks and lately recently she talks very little, mostly mumbling(before this even a month ago she used to talk a lot). 

She can't walk or refuses to move at all, we have to drag her to the toilet(my back hurts a lot).

Sleeps all day and night and before this she used to stay up usually crying.

This all seems like a new stage, or maybe It's some sort of symptoms she's going through because she fell on her behind lately also... It's all so confusing.

Anyways, how long would grandma last like this?",1
"Hi Friends. I have so appreciated the input I’ve received in this group! I need help again. Mom and Dad live in Florida, far away from all of their kids. They are in their 80’s and Mom has Alzheimer’s (mild dementia stage). They are going to move into one of Florida’s wonderful Assisted Living facilities but dad is set on one that does not have a memory care unit. He actually thinks they can move into the Independent Living section as it is cheaper and he says they don’t need extra help yet. I understand how unwise this is but there is no getting through to dad. He’s even willing for them to be on a one year waiting list because the food is best at this place, and he likes the floor plan. Dad is unstable on his feet already and I cannot see them letting him be the sole caregiver especially after she grows more needy w dressing, bathing, eating. I told him I don’t think they will even allow her to reside w him if she is at that stage eventually (we know she will be too). What are the chances that a place without Memory Care assistance would even let them in? I told him to call the office and make sure if this and he did say that he would call them today….UGH!!!!",1
"She has pre-Alzheimer’s and is starting to forget things and pretty much rewrite events in her mind to match her skewed thoughts. An arbitrary example would be:

Mom: “Alright, we’re going to the park on Tuesday.”

Me: “Sweet. I’ll bring a cooler so we can have a small picnic.”

*Tuesday morning*

Me: “Okay mom, I packed the cooler. Let’s have some fun today!”

Mom: “Huh? What are you talking about? We’re going to the park on Friday, not Tuesday.”

Me: *pause…* “Oh, I see. My mistake. Friday it is, then! I can’t wait!”

Every one of these interactions is making me die a little inside. I’ve come a long way emotionally and mentally but seeing the one parent I have left suffer like this is too much. I could use some help. Anyone know of any support groups? Remote Zoom calls maybe? Literally anything to talk and get things off my chest. Thanks.",1
"I want to do something special for my MIL because she has been the primary caregiver for my FIL for the past couple of years. He now needs to go into an assisted living community, and she has been very emotional about it. Does anyone have any ideas of something I can do for her? I have been helping her with tasks around the house, but I would love to give her a sentimental gift or something. Any ideas?",1
"So my grandmother has always been very traditional and appearance was very important to her. She has severe alzheimer so showering has become an issue. She gets defensive everytime its mentioned like we just said the most horrible thing ever to her. Calls us every nasty name in the book cause we even questioned that she might not have showered or washed her hair.

She screams for help like she’s getting assaulted when you try to help her shower with some screams about how she of course showered already.

Any ideas?",1
"My mother felt and now she has a pelvic fracture.
Doctor said that the fracture is adrelatively easy and no need surgery but she has to lie for at least several days. My mother already has some advanced form of Alzheimer which means that all the time she restlessly went back and forth almost all day long.
Now when I try to persuade her to lie down (we are in hospital right now and the doctor said she shouldn't stand on her legs at all) she becomes very aggressive.

Any advice on what I can do?",1
"So my dad has had dementia for 7 years now but in the last few weeks he has stopped walking, is essentially bedridden and has trouble swallowing so now all his food is blended.

"Mom has early mid-stage Alzheimer’s. Her sister died, and she would like to go to the funeral. Putting aside the considerable emotional issues surrounding that, we need to decide if we are going to drive or fly. Flight time, with layovers would be 8-10 hours. Driving will take 2-4 days, depending on how hard we push. We are planning about a week to ten days of visiting family, which will involve some half day drives as well. Either way there will be two caregivers on the trip. Has anyone been on a road trip with their LO? Any advice? Would you choose to fly instead if you had to do it again?",1
"Hope I’m not doing anything against the rules but I could do with your help. 

My father is suffering with Alzheimer’s and recently has started to leave the house with nothing except for the clothes he’s wearing. My mum is starting to struggle with hip problems so isn’t as mobile as she was or my dad.  A couple of times we’ve needed to call the police who have found him locally and brought him home.  But tO be able to find him if he walks off easily I’d like to buy him a small gps tracker with a phone sim so we can find him.  He doesn’t take his phone, and I’ve tried with an apple airtag with no luck as they’re semi rural. 

Can anyone recommend a suitable tracker that can be clipped to his clothes fairly discreetly that would be suitable?

"Sorry, this is really long.

Hello, I'm 18 years old. My Nana was diagnosed with alzheimers about 5 years ago. She is 89. Up until the beginning of this year it was an extremely slow progression. She might mention something twice or couldn't place a name. As soon as she said it the second time or was reminded of the person she would remember  though. The most significant thing was that she no longer brought up things or could have a real conversation. It was 100% small talk. She couldn't tell a story or refer back to something. It wasn't interfering with every day life and otherwise things were pretty manageable. She was and is physically doing great. She can lift a 30lb chair and move it around and goes up/down stairs fine. She can volley a few  times when we play tennis.  She bends over to pick stuff up and has no trouble with any of this. She knows how to do things but it she can't remember to do it. She still says grace at the table.

"Hi everyone.
Two weeks ago my grandmother was rushed to hospital after vomiting and severe diarrhea. She was given an incorrect fatal diagnosis and was put in hospice. She didn't end up having something fatal, we're still not sure what exactly happened. She has a follow up with a GI soon.

The issue is that she was given morphine every day every three hours in hospice care, and I think the morphine really deteriorated her mental state. She is still on morphine for pain she is having in her toe (pain that will be resolved soon when she has a procedure to remove a clogged artery), but she is acting like a full blown dementia patient. Part of me thinks it's just the medication and that when she stops taking it everything will be okay. But I'm just not sure.

I am just crying so much because I feel like she might already be gone in the sense that I'll never get to chat with her and gossip and just have a normal conversation. I feel so mad because the first few days of hospice she was totally fine but then she just got worse and worse and now she's hardly speaking to us at all.

Is there any chance this is all temporary and after she's off morphine she will go back to being herself?",1
"Hello! Quick question -- is there some aspect of Alzheimer's /dementia that interferes with a person's sensitivity to temperature? If not, what else might be going on?

Where my mother-in-law lives, they are having typical summer temps that can easily climb above 100. Despite this, when my husband isn't with her, she won't turn on her AC at all. We / he will turn it on and insist she leave it alone so the house can cool off. But we've found that she doesn't like the temp below 80. We will leave a fan on in the den, and she starts asking if anyone is cold & she should turn it off. Or if she should turn off the AC & open windows. 

In the winter, however, she claimed never to get cold. She wore a light windbreaker all winter, despite cold snaps that could get near in the single digits (°F).",1
"I know a lot of Alzheimer’s patients will have stories that they tell that aren’t true, she hasn’t gotten there yet but she is talking a lot about her life. More than what she would ever.


Some wild things are said, but I actually really love the vulgar language from her. She was not always cussing a storm but she has said words, so that kind of makes me happy she is still sort of that way.

She asks a lot about her dad. She also asks about her grandparents, but for now she remembers they died; and how. She is about 4-5 years in this battle but I can see how strong she still is.


Yesterday I was there sitting with her, my aunt (her daughter) is out of town for a funeral, and I was moving the camera in her bedroom so my aunt can see her better while gone. She wanted to know what I was doing and I told her that was a camera so so and so can see you. She said , “oh really? She can see me from Michigan? I hope she doesn’t watch me masturbate.” 

Literally tears of laughter because it is so damn funny. I know people wouldn’t think that but for some reason my grandmother talks a lot about what a sl*t she was. She also says she was terrible to her first husband. I usually confirm these things with my aunt and she says it’s all true. 



I am just dreading the day where she doesn’t remember me though. I spent a lot of my childhood with her; she practically raised me. She said she didn’t think she would live to see me turn 30 but this last Saturday was my 30th birthday. So I am happy to say she was wrong.


Anyways; sorry for the word vomit. Just had to share a few things about her. Thanks for reading.",1
"Went to dinner with Mom, she’s kind of still got it but it’s so tiring and frustrating. She wanted to watch a television show; I went to record it for her and she’s watched it. She says she hasn’t, even though I went through all the episodes and she says she’s seen them. My SO doesn’t get my frustration when I express it to them. Their Mother died of brain cancer so they “get it” and I shouldn’t bring it home and argue about it.  I’m not arguing, I’m trying to explain my frustration",1
"Today is my first birthday without my mom knowing it unprompted, almost a year into her diagnosis. I had expected her to forget it last year, but she managed to hang on and knew it was, and really started to decline right after. I tried to have a nice moment with her this morning and told her it was my birthday thinking that maybe we could sing the happy birthday song, but the Alzheimer’s response in her was: “Ahhhhhhhhhhhh I’m going to die.”

But at 6:07 this evening (my birth time) and after she had just called me “mom” a few minutes before, which shows the swing of this, I got a bit of a gift when I asked her what happened at 6:07 on June 26th, to which she replied “your birthday” and she told me she loved me and that she was sorry (which she also says a lot these days 🥺). So she came back to me a bit for that moment, which I will cherish forever.

Otherwise, while I didn’t get to connect with my mom in the way that I would have liked to for the whole day on my birthday, I did have a chance to connect with Mother Nature (thanks to a hired caregiver) and I took myself to the Monterey Bay for the day for a whale watching tour. We saw a pod of humpback whales, and then a pod of risso’s dolphins, and a superpod of a couple hundred pacific white sided dolphins, which was super cool. I have been so sad and emotional most of the day though, which has really sucked, but at least I wasn’t stuck and sad at home the whole day. The sea life did lift my spirits a bit. These chances to get out are so few and far between.",1
"My mom was diagnosed only about a month ago. She is in early stages but has had symptoms for a long time - several years. It has been much worse this year and she can’t remember what the doctor says or what’s going on most of the time. So when she was diagnosed the doctors told her and my dad together and she accepted what they said. By the next day she had forgotten. My dad recorded the session with the doctors (for the rest of the family to listen to) including the part where they explain her diagnosis. Mom is generally anxious and somewhat aggressive the past few months and my dad who lives alone with her was scared to bring it up again because she gets super mad at him. SO it just gets left and we don’t talk about it. Meanwhile when she is confused or anxious sometimes we can’t calm her down and she gets stuck in “loops” and she knows nothing makes sense - the missing piece in those moments is she doesn’t know about her diagnosis).

So recently we’ve been together and during a loop meltdown moment - my husband decided to bring it up again and he told her kindly and honestly about it her diagnosis. It actually led to a good discussion with my dad too and she asked to hear the tape with the doctor. Then of course by a few hours later she forgot the whole thing.

Yesterday she got stuck in a long loop and was really anxious and angry but not making sense. I suggested to dad that maybe he try telling her again (since nothing else was working). He did and while it took longer than the previous time - she again understood and while she was sad and scared she wasn’t confused in the same way. Interestingly she has now held on to the convo - at least the idea she has Alzheimer’s - since about 4pm yesterday and it’s already lunch today! Amazing! But likely she will forget or get confused about it again soon.

So my question is - and thank you for reading this far! - is it better to tell them or not? And if so when how and how often? I can’t decide if it’s scarier for her to know or scarier to be confused when the world doesn’t make sense and you don’t know why. 

Also if she knows - How involved in decisions about her own care can she be? She already can’t decide what to eat and we have to tell her so it’s hard to know if she could have input about her care?

I really appreciate any input or experience with this. Trying to help my parents live their best life while my mom has Alzheimer’s 💜",1
"One month ago grandma was walking and eating solids. Three weeks ago she fells and gashed her head. Since then, she stopped walking and starting eating baby food. Two weeks ago we finally got her into a nursing home. Today, she is steadily sedated, not eating, and sentenced to death. I don't want her to be in pain but I also don't think this should be the hospice nurses decision.

"My parents, my wife, and I have always taken care of grandma. A little over a week ago we were able to get her into a nursing home. I got a call today from the nurse saying they expect she has about a week to live. I knew this was approaching as she was becoming less responsive and recently stopped walking. But I can't help feeling somehow responsible, as if I abandoned her after a lifetime together. Logically I know this isn't true but emotionally the feeling lingers. What are your experiences with similar situations?   
Thank you.",1
"I seem to be noticing a pattern with my mom (alzheimers/dementia 83) exhibiting pretty intense agitation that starts almost immediately after eating.  For example today it went from a baseline of happy/content, typical confusion, and enjoyable mealtime to...intense frustration, agitation, name calling, anger, etc almost right after lunch.  This lasted a couple hours, then comfortably back to baseline.  Then, again right after dinner the same cycle and basically back to baseline before bed.  The meals were typical protein, carb, soup, dessert.  Just wondering during if anyone else has noticed this pattern??",1
"I am not a cryer, and probably cry 1-2 times per year and today was one of them. I desperately needed support, and called my early-onset Alzheimer’s mother.. and was just even more devastated and frustrated than before. It’s like talking to a brick wall with a 2-minute memory who has no understanding or perspective of what I’m saying. 

I’m only 30 years old and I don’t know a single person my age who has had to face anything like this with their parents, unless they are deceased. In a lot of ways, I think it would be easier to grieve the death of my mother instead of having a mother who is still living on Earth, but can’t support me in any way, or connect with me at all. Our relationship was always strained and she is mentally ill/alcoholic, which makes the dynamic even more complicated.",1
"So my father (57,white) have a severe memory problem. He literally forget my name where he calls me different names and important dates and stuff like his keys and phone. We took him to 4 neurologist and did MRI and so many tests and none was indicative of dementia/Alzheimer except for small white matter hyper-intensity. But the neurologist disregard it since it's small and probably old.

However his forgetfulness is unbearable and greatly interferes with his daily life and cause so much stress to him and us. 

He doesn't have any motor problems and can do complex math calculations (mentally dividing numbers or getting % out of numbers, like what's 22% out of 940)

I'm asking if there is a drug that can help, someone recommended acti-brain but it's not approved by FDA..",1
"I’m going to visit my grandma for 4 days from this Thursday. The last time I saw her was around 9 months ago since she lives pretty far away and at that point she was just a little confused and disoriented but nothing hugely concerning. Since then she’s gone downhill a lot and has to have a full time carer. The other day she tried to exit the bathroom via the shower and was really scared and confused. She hasn’t had the Alzheimer’s diagnosis yet but we’re all pretty sure it’s on the way.

The last time I visited a relative with Alzheimer’s was when I visited my great-grandma with some family when I was like 7. She couldn’t remember who me, my grandma or my dad were despite us being her daughter, grandson and great-granddaughter. I just remember finding it all so difficult that I cried the entire way home. 

I absolutely adore my grandma and she used to have such an amazing mind. I’m really nervous about the visit.

I’d really appreciate any tips on how to cope with it and also how to actually approach my grandma in a way that won’t make her any more scared and confused than she already is.

UPDATE: She got the results back from a recent test and it’s looking like she almost certainly has dementia. To hear it in plain terms is scary because it makes it much more real. I’m still nervous about the visit but everybody’s advice and support so far is very very comforting and reassuring. Thank you all so much. <3",1
"I don’t want to be on this subreddit. At all. But here I am and hopefully someone can shed some light. 

My mom is 67 and has always struggled with memory. It’s Father’s Day, so I’m back “home” and my dad said he’s been reading a lot about this disease because my mom is getting worse, fast. Walking is difficult for her , having stability , she fell last week. Her grandmother died of this disease. My mom is also bipolar and I’m reading a lot online and the correlation between these two diseases/disorders is so terrifying. Is anyone familiar with someone who has both diagnoses?

"Hi everyone, my grandmother was diagnosed with alzheimers, she has been as confused lately and is getting better at remembering. When my mother passed I realised I didn’t actually know a lot about her life and regret it a lot. I’d like to ask my grandma questions about her life every time I go visit her, try record her life for the rest of the family. 

Although I have a degree in history, I was wondering what kind of questions you would suggest asking? I don’t want to trigger her or upset her in anyway, she’s typically very chatty so I doubt it would come to that, but anything would be appreciated!",1

"My anxiety has been increasing because of my fear that my mom (62) or dad (68) will get dementia. Thankfully, they do not share any symptoms of any cognitive impairment. Sometimes, my dad may get a little bit confused while driving. that normally happens because he has his earbuds in and is listening to the news so he is a little distracted. However, he knows his way around the city and drives himself everywhere all the time. Regardless, I have this paralyzing fear that my mom or dad may get dementia in the future. 

How can I cope with this? Also, is there anything they can do to minimize their risk of developing the condition/taking preventative measures?",1
"Hasn't gotten to the point of physically abusive yet. But very damn near close to it. Does throw things and punch the hole in the wall a couple times. Always angry, easily agitated. And lately he's been getting angry at the conversations that never happened. He'll be convinced that he was fighting with you earlier in the day when you weren't even around him.

I saw someone in another post suggest risperidone, But a cursory search of antipsychotics for dementia shows that it could lead to death. Am I reading that right? 

What are some medications that could calm him down or maybe even completely sedate him?

Edit: I know that this is a conversation I should be having with a doctor. But I wanted to know what I was talking about before I talked to him. Was just looking for a place to start. Thank you.",1
"Mom basically rejected the doctor's diagnosis and, in her denial, was convinced that she could find the right supplement to cure her 'memory problems.' When she was still early stage, she would drop out of or shut down any conversation where I used the word ""Alzheimer's."" 

Now the disease has progressed past the point where she can comprehend it. We went from ""my memory issues"" to ""my memory loss"" without her ever processing the diagnosis. 

I'm curious how common that is with others. Did you ever get to talk with your loved one about the disease when they were still early stage? If you did, was it helpful for either your or them? 

Communication and connection was never my mom's forte, so I'm curious if we are outliers or if the reality of the diagnosis itself is often lost on patients.",1
"Hey everyone - first time posting but been reading and seeing some good ideas and advice from people with more experience. 

My mom is 75 and recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s but showing various symptoms for some time. 

For the last several months she had been obsessing about various minor medical ailments. She has been the doctor and dentist many many times for each sore throat, bump on my head, my saliva tastes like acid, my fingers tingle I have frostbite etc etc. She uses the internet to look up her symptoms and always decides she has something terrible or deadly. And she can get stuck in a confused loop about a symptom - eg my throat is dry I need to drink water - water tastes bad - everything tastes bad - the air in here is bad I need to go outside - steps outside for 30sec - comes in my throat is dry - back to the beginning…

This started small and has developed into almost a 24/7 thing - she wakes up in the night obsessing about things - it’s the first thing we deal with In the morning. And at various points in the day unless there is a MAJOR and engaging distraction. Yesterday I was able to break a loop by starting an exciting conversation about our kids university graduation and getting the group talking with her about it quickly. The trick seemed to be engaging her fully into something else before she even realizes it and then she drops the loop. But I haven’t been able to do that successfully alone and I’ve only even done it with the whole family there a couple of times… has anyone here experienced something like this? Any ideas of what works or doesn’t? 

This has become the forefront of her thoughts it seems - like default mode - I live out of town and when I said goodbye this morning she wasn’t interested in me (her daughter) or saying goodbye or any of the normal mother/daughter goodbye things - instead she looped on about her sore throat and even followed me out tho the elevator after we had left still obsessing and needing help (acting as if it’s WAY more serious than it is).

We try to acknowledge her feeling at really - your throat really bothers you - but also reassure her it’s not serious - and even go to many drs to verify… 

Help!!!

And thank you. ❤️",1
"Update… he is still at it.  We are going along, following the advice, and trying to distract, but he has called 911 and is convinced that he hasn’t seen her in days.  The police said there is nothing they can do.  We take the phone away but he starts to get angry and demands his phone.  Then calls everyone he knows begging for help.  He says he doesn’t know why she has left him and doesn’t know what he did to upset her.  It is so sad.

He is confused.  He thinks my mother, his wife, is upset with him and has left him.  He says he is heartbroken and doesn’t know why she would leave him, that he thought she loved him.  He believes she is staying over at my brothers house, who is a mile away.  He is constant;y begging us to go get her and bring her home.

She calls him and he believes it’s her in the phone.  She will tell him, I’m on the way home and he gets excited.  Then when she walks in he says, “where’s my wife?  You are not her, your the other lady who he,ps my wife around the house”.  BTW, we don’t and never have had a housekeeper.

He is getting increasingly sad and bothered.  Playing along in his world is not working.  I am afraid he is going to get very upset soon.  He is paralyzed from the waist down too so we don’t have to worry about him trying to leave but, he is getting very agitated.

I don’t know what to do. 😢",1
"I guess I just came here to say that it's sad to watch my slowly aging parents to continue to go downhill.  I had one grandparent diagnosed with Alzheimer's and another grandparent who had dementia at least.  I remember my grandpa believing that he was back in WW2 and him thinking that my grandma was the enemy while barricading himself in a room . . . seriously.  Now that my parents are getting up there in age, they have their own difficulties.  I mean, I expect them to have physical problems as they continue to age, but they seem to be slipping mentally as well.  What's even more strange to me, is that they seem to be suffering very different ailments.  My mom seems to have more and more trouble from a common-sense perspective.  She is slower to comprehend, has trouble understand fast or complicated things, and is often forgetful.  On the other hand, my dad seems to have issues from a sanity perspective.  He sometimes misunderstands reality and thinks that half the situations in life are conspiracies.  I brought up the topic of their mental health with them once, and I think one of them even went to get evaluated by a professional.  But I also noticed that I deeply offended them by even mentioning it in the first place.  I guess I am just frustrated by having to face their inevitable difficulties in the future.  In fact, this is one of the reasons that I plan to retire soon myself; because I know they'll need more and more help with things.  I have to assume that at least one of them is likely developing Alzheimer's.  Just venting I guess.",1
"My grandmother hasn’t had the greatest memory since turning 80 but she always recognized me when I visited or called. She was hospitalized for a stroke last week and the contrast is night and day. She doesn’t recognize me anymore. We’ve always lived nearby each other and she was my de facto parent for so many years of my childhood. You always think there’s more time to spend together before something this traumatic happens. She’s no where near the same as she was and has lost all independence. At 86, She lived by herself with a home health aide’s assistance twice a week. Now she needs full time care. We’ve selected a private facility for now but this place has a two week waiting period before visits are allowed. Is this common? Is this to make sure the patients are acclimated before family can see them? I can’t help but imagine how scary this change is going to be for her. And I can’t stand that I have to be away from her that long.",1
"So, I am just perplexed and I have no idea what is going on. My grandmother (who is 89) was thought to have Alzheimer's.My cousin who is a doctor, aunt who is Psychiatrist, mom who is a nurse, and myself (not a medical doctor, but a doctorate in the biological sciences and work in environmental health) all swore by this. Her behavior (inability to have a deep conversation, or respond to her environment, walk to places on her own, mostly reflected this). I say mostly because there was something (in hindsight) that I noticed. When she would see me, she would call me by the pet name that she gave me. In addition, my ex is a nurse who specifically worked with patents with Alzheimers and dementia, and while she said she believed she (my grandmother) had Alzheimer's, she also swore that ""she was there more than we thought she was"". Regardless, it felt like a personal loss. 

Anyways, three days ago she went to the hospital due to a UTI infection....and yesterday, I swear it was like none of this happened. She was entirely ""here"". She spoke and had normal conversations like before her diagnosis, she read (like before her diagnosis), she knew about everything happening in the world at this time (her family fled the Iron Curtain so she was interested in Ukraine. She also remembered everything my family would talk with her about when she ""had"" Alzheimer's. Perhaps the strangest thing, is that before, she was a pianist and had a grand piano and would play every night. She played piano...and she played beautifully.

Look, I may not be a medical doctor, but I am a scientist so I am not going to use the word ""miracle"" but it felt miraculous. At the same time...there has to be an explanation. Obviously in the next few days my family are going to try to figure this out. But in the meantime, I am just left wondering what happened? What did she have beforehand? And why is she suddenly better? It feels like a strange restart in life, like another chance to get to know her and I am simply perplexed.

Thank you",1
"My father is in the early stages of Alzheimer’s and is confusing my mother with a stranger/housekeeper.  He claims my mother is missing even though several family members have told him otherwise.

My mother is also incapable of providing him the proper help.  Which is why my wife and I moved in about a year ago to help them out.

How do I help without getting the system involved?  My wife and I are capable of caring for them, but not sure how to go about it.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 😢",1
"Just sort of writing out what’s happening and how I’m feeling about it. I have amazing friends who would be glad to listen and support me, but luckily for the them, they do not truly understand the disease and how it has affected my mom and our family. 

My mom is 64 and was diagnosed about 4 years ago - she has been living in a memory care unit at a nursing home since around September of 2020. My brother and his partner were his main caretakers (bless them, they did it much longer than I could have) and I lived pretty close by so I saw her relatively often. I haven’t really wanted to visit her since she’s been in the home. For the past two years or so she has really started to hate women and has just become plain mean. My brothers partner got the brunt of it but anytime I’d visit I’d get it too. In her right mind, my mom was the sweetest woman ever and I’d never really heard her say anything bad about anyone ever. With Alzheimer’s though it has changed, the last time I visited her in person she called me a fat cunt and clearly my presence upset her. I can separate the disease from my mom. I know that it wasn’t actually her saying those things, but regardless, it was still sad to see. If she in her right mind could see how she was living right now, she’d be so mad that she’s still alive. 

Anyway, she’s been very sick the past week or so. My brother told me she’s not really eating, not walking, just generally very withdrawn. Two weeks ago she was doing all of those things just fine so it was a very quick decline. She had blood work done and it came back with the strong possibility of cancer. Since she is so far gone with Alzheimer’s we will not be pursuing treatment and have decided to prioritize comfort from now on. 

I am really hoping that this will be it and her suffering will end soon. We don’t want to put her through the process of figuring out what kind of cancer it is because the tests would freak her out, but we also don’t know what kind of cancer it is or what stage. I do wish we had a bit more of a timeline so I could mentally prepare. Guess I’m hoping that since the decline was so quick that the whole process will be that quick too. 

Thanks everyone for listening to me vent - my brothers partner is the one who first mentioned this subreddit to me years ago and it has been a great help over that time. I was definitely not expecting to have to deal with all of this in my 20's.",1
"My dad has Alzheimer's. My step-mom has called twice in the last week because my dad doesn't recognize her, says his wife his out of the house, and thinks my step-mom has broken in to steal his wife's purse.  

My step-mom calls because she wants me to tell my dad that she is in fact his wife.  I think this will just agitate him.  I'd rather play it off that she's a caretaker watching him until his wife returns.  Any advice?   

I should add that on these phone calls my dad sounds confident, strong and and lucid.  He sounds better on these calls than he usually does where he mumbles, can't find words and sounds weak.",1
"Basically the title. My father is 60 years old and began showing symptoms of early Alzheimer’s about 4-5 years ago. It started with him just forgetting things occasionally such as appointments, directions, as well as mood swings and irritation. My mother and I chalked it up to maybe being age, vitamin deficiency, or thyroid issues, however it has gotten progressively worse as the years have gone by. We can be having a conversation with him and after the conversation he’ll walk away, turn around 10 seconds later and say “now what was I about to do? What were we just talking about.” He’s began to have issues handling his finances on time, he used to have a computer business, and now he has trouble remembering how to use his phone or computer. When I have an appointment or have to be somewhere at a certain time, he asks, no joke, more than a dozen times in a day, sometimes within a few hours, what time it is or where it is, and says he didn’t remember. He’s also began having a “loss of words” not being able to recall the word for an object and stuttering trying to find the words to speak. He misplaces and loses things all the time and is not able to retrace his steps, often blaming my mother and I for moving stuff around or stealing things, only to find it later in a spot he usually leaves his things. He also stopped socializing with people and is often irritable with others, suspicious, and has mood swings. My mom and I, as well as other family members have brought up these symptoms with him and urged him to see his doctor, but refuses. He thinks that nothing is wrong with him. How can we convince him to see a doctor. These symptoms have been getting worse very recently, and we are worried that if he doesn’t go to a doctor to see what is causing this, that one day he may wake up and not recognize us. He has a family history of Alzheimer’s and dementia. My grandfather, as well as great aunts had it.",1
"Hi everyone,

I am just wondering if anyone has any advice for my family who are primarily caring for my Grandma. She is in her mid-late stages of Alzheimer’s and she has been increasingly more angry and agitated.

A few times a week she has been going to a dementia facility day care thing called Memory Lane, this acts as a few hours respite for my Grandad a week. However, the last few times she has had to be sent home as she has been kicking, shouting, yelling “I want to go home” - potentially frightening the other patients there. 

This type of behaviour we were used to, but it only occurred during sundowning periods. We would usually walk my Grandma around the block in an evening to calm her and tell her we are going home, and then ask her to point out her house and she would feel comforted. It would act as a memory refresh almost?

Regardless, this anger has begun to start midday and even when she is on sedatives. To the point where Memory Lane is no longer a viable option. My Grandad has told me he would rather die than put my Grandma in a full time care home so that is not an option either.

Does anyone have any other advice?
Thank you",1
"Hubby is at his mom's in another state for a few weeks to help her out. Her dementia is so up and down. Some days she can function ok and has a good overall affect. Then other days she seems to pick fights from the moment her eyes open. Today is one such day. She doesn't cook anymore for the most part, and certainly not when she's alone. (Aside from putting things in the microwave.) When he's there, she does insist on making breakfast. It's still muscle memory for her after all the years of breakfast for her husband. (Sometimes she seems to think that's who she is cooking for now)
So, hubby says he told her the breakfast was really good and he appreciated it. She replied, ""well I'm glad you could gag it down."" Instead of changing the subject or moving on, he had to fight back. ""You're right. I take it back. It was so bad I will just cook for myself from now on."" SMH  Then he wonders why she asked him why he's always mad at her and hateful. 

I probably should have bit my tongue, but I told him he has to develop a thicker skin if he wants to be her caretaker, that she's no more in control of lashing out than a colicky baby crying for hours. Something is frustrating her, so she's communicating the only way she can. 

He didn't like that response, so end of discussion. 

He does have siblings, one living in their hometown about a mile or less from their mom. That sibling helps as well, although doesn't want to deal with all the legal responsibilities or try to get outside help to come in/move mom to a care facility. The other siblings live hours away and are good with that, having minimal contact with her. My husband doesn't want to put her in a care facility but is quickly realizing it's either that or he moves in with her. (But his job is here, and it's flexible but definitely not 100% remote.)

I guess I am frustrated in part because I don't know what to say to my husband to support him or get him to change his approach, and also because I get upset that his mom is not being cared for better by anyone else. Any advice?",1
"How do you determine when is the best time to move a parent to assisted living ?

I have been taking care of my mother for 5 years now.  She has early stage dementia but also has constant health issues.  I have given up literally everything to take care of my parent.  My father and brother both passed away in the last few years so have minimal help now.

My mother is not really bad yet, but I hate to have random people come in the house to sit with her, as I still will need to do all the doctors appts, manage finances, cook, etc.  Also she is immune compromised so do not want ""outside help"" to come in as she is super high risk for COVID.",1
"My mom (62) was diagnosed with moderate Alzheimer’s recently. She’s also been declining very quickly, two years ago she could make an appointment and take herself to the dentist and now she can barely brush her teeth. Her primary doctor, neurologist, and neuropsychologist have all said she shouldn’t be driving anymore.

She hasn’t had any accidents as far as I can tell, but she’s gotten lost a few times. I also know from how she acts with me driving in the car that she’s terrified of being on the road, going faster than 30mph, leaving our neighborhood, of sirens, and of every other car around us.

I’m 23 and the only person living with her, and I’m financially dependent on her. I work part time because I can’t leave her alone for very long.

I don’t know how to get her to stop driving. She gets violent with me, my dog, and my car. She threatens to kick me out, which I know she’s beyond being able to do, but anytime I mention her not driving anymore it’s not safe for me to be anywhere near her.

I’m not POA, and the person who is hasn’t been helpful.

Hiding the keys hasn’t worked, and I don’t think reporting her to the DMV would either because she’d forget/think they’re lying/not care and do it anyway.

She also has friends in the area who will take her to buy a new key to the car if I hide it and otherwise enable her. Talking to them doesn’t help.",1
"Hi everyone, I’m new here and just looking for advice and support. My MIL is stage 6 and has lived in Memory Care since her husband died October 2020. She was diagnosed last month with UTI for the first time since being placed. She had become withdrawn and refused to go to meals so that’s how they found out. Did course of antibiotics but delirium came next and she ended up in our neighborhood (small) hospital. After a few days of IV antibiotics, they released her back to MC with oral antibiotics and home health physical therapy. Well over the weekend she became severely combative and delusional again. MC called hubby and said she must go somewhere, so back to ER (bigger hospital). They were able to sedate her enough to sleep a few hours (she never sleeps longer than a few minutes), and she was so much better Sunday. Yesterday she gets combative, delusional and even violent. They now have her restrained and she refuses to eat “in the bed.” Physically she’s still pretty spry but she either can’t hear or can’t comprehend most of what we say for about the last six months. Still calls a few of us by name occasionally. It seems we’re in a bad cycle and we don’t know what to do, or what we should ask for. The restraints seem cruel to me but I get why they did it (she has pulled out IVs and tried to leave room, besides being violent). Anyone else been through antibiotics resistant UTIs with your loved ones? What should we do?",1
"He doesn't even have gray hair yet, but he is quickly losing cognition even though he looks normal. 

My dad talks everyday about getting a car and will walk to dealerships with all his money when my mom leaves for work. He is not allowed to drive, but doesn't believe this.

I help the best I can. Sometimes having him at my house, other times checking in with him, other times driving around to find him. 

It's hard to manage because I have 3 young children, a business, and a part time job. I don't know what to do. 

We don't want him in a nursing home. It would kill him. An at-home nurse wouldn't be able to keep my dad in the house.

Any suggestions?",1
"My grand grand mother Ina 92 years old. She hasn't been diagnosed, but she shows all signs of a patient with Alzheimer's disease.

When I talk to her she believes I am my dad, and she is talking to my dad. Should I play along with narratives such as this or should I remind her every time of the truth?",1
"So my Aunt has early onset alzheimers and she was diagnosed 5 or so years ago. We started noticing symptoms before that, but could never get her to go to the doctor for it. 
My mother is her primary care taker and took her to see her neurology doctor. Doc says that she may only have 6 months or so left based on the state of progression. Obviously no one can know for sure. But still. 
I want to know how she comes to that conclusion? 
I will say, we've noticed my aunt declining more rapidly in the past couple months and I've been told it kind of snowballs... but her body still works ok! We still take her on walks, she can feed herself when she isn't distracted, and she still drives to the grocery store well enough...(just kidding)
 Her speech however is not great anymore. Most things she says don't make sense.
Aside from speech and incontinence, she doesn't seem to be shutting down? 
Has anyone else been here and been super confused? 
I realize I'm probably in denial and I'm ok with that. I just need to know how accurate they are able to make guesses and how they come to these decisions..",1

I want more time with my dad than this. I just graduated college, moved away. But my dad is losing his memory, and a lot of it is already gone. 

He’s definitely had it for years but he lived alone and that made it worse. He’s only now getting cognitive testing and it’s progressed so much in the past year. 

We were close. I miss him so much. It’s like half of him is gone. I don’t want to move back to that city, but I’m worried one day I’ll come back and he won’t remember me. 

He says he’s happy. But that he misses me. He has photos laid out all around his house so he doesn’t forget anything. But he couldn’t remember my birthday. Each second with him hurts because I just think about how he used to be. So full of life. So smart. The funniest weirdest guy ever. He still is weird, so at least there’s that. 

I just miss him, and harbor a lot of guilt about our relationship. I don’t know what to do. I love my dad. I love him so much.",1
"I think only the loved ones of Alzheimer’s patience can understand both the relief and horror of finding out that they’re otherwise “a perfectly healthy specimen, better than anyone in their age group.” 

My dad is on year 5 of his dementia diagnosis and year 1 of his suspected Alzheimer’s diagnosis. He was feeling short of breath and tingly and wanted to go to the ER so I took him. He couldn’t tell them why he was there, he couldn’t figure out how to sign the paperwork because he forgot his initials, and he kept the poor nurse trapped in the looping conversation for ten minutes while I tried it help the poor guy escape tactfully. 

Doctor comes in, says he’s a perfect specimen and it’s okay to be cautious but he’s perfectly healthy. I had expected dehydration and maybe a bladder infection? None of that. 

It means we’re in this for the long haul; that it won’t be a sudden heart attack that ends it sooner. It means that his rapid decline the last 5 weeks wasn’t because of a possible bladder infection. It means that he’s just declining that fast. How can we be both relieved and saddened by such good news?

He’s been walking around the house saying “I’m perfect!” And asking “how would you describe my health to someone?”

Oh, and don’t forget that he looked at me and said “You have a lot of gray hairs. From stress? What’s stressful?”",1

"My mom (61 y.o.) was diagnosed last year with early-onset Alzheimer's, and she's due to go in for her first yearly checkup and follow up memory testing. We hope to see how quickly things are declining, since now we have a baseline to compare to. We made an appointment months ago for this Thursday, and she casually told me today that she called and cancelled it!! She doesn't want to go, she doesn't think she needs to go, she feels the ""games"" (tests) are dumb, she feels stupid when we go, etc. She REALLY doesn't want to go. I get it, but she has to go! So I called to reschedule, and the earliest available appointment they have is end of August...

Feeling very defeated about all of this, but we now have a note in her file that she's not allowed to cancel her own appointments (they'll call me if she tries). 

Is anyone else experiencing difficulty getting their loved ones to the doctor? Have any strategies been helpful? Honestly, I'm so new at this (I'm 29F), and my dad and I do the best we can, but it's been really tough. Any kind words or words of wisdom would be wonderful ❤",1

"Hi, I am hoping someone can help me out.

Up until last Friday my 78 year old mother in law was living with my brother in law. Last Fri my BIL got high on heroin, tied a rope around his neck and stepped off a ladder. MIL came to live with my husband (her oldest son) and me last Sat afternoon.

BIL told us a while ago that MIL had been diagnosed with dementia but I don't know exactly when they got that diagnosis, and worst of all she has type 2 diabetes. She has no prescriptions.

She refuses to accept that she has diabetes. She has been craving chocolate ice cream and has asked for a bowl of it every night since she came. I have told her repeatedly that she has diabetes and needs to lay off the sweets but she insists she feels fine and no doctor has ever told her she is diabetic. Today she went to the kitchen and got a bowl of chocolate ice cream, turned her chair to face the wall presumably so I wouldn't see, and ate it. An hour later she got up and did it again. When lunchtime came around she asked me if I would get her a bowl of ice cream. When I checked her sugar, she was at 587. I showed her the meter, explained her sugar was high and she could not have any more sweets, and she accused me of hating her because I'm taking 'all the good stuff' away from her.

Note that her sister is a full-on Q-Anon devotee and has been telling her she can eat whatever she wants and not to listen to doctors because they don't know anything. Mom had also been told by her sister not to listen to the Chinese Cow (I'm actually Korean but that doesn't make a difference to a racist.) I am at my wits end, her sugar is dangerously high and she is stealing ice cream and the kids' cookies and she won't listen to me.

I am working on getting money together to get her to a dr, we were not expecting Mom to have to move in with us and it has strained our finances because even though she was collecting social security,  my BIL has been 'handling' her money and we have no idea where all her money was going.

How do I get her to understand she's diabetic and needs to stop eating sugary stuff?",1
"The MIL lives with my spouse and I, the MIL has been diagnosed, and is on whatever meds are available. The spouse and I get along with our neighbours and street fantastically! Over the last week, the MIL has hit the stage where she pulling us aside and accusing the neighbours of various transgressions.  Last night, the MIL woke up my two teens at 2am to complain about the neighbour and how much of a jerk he is and the problems he has caused.  The neighbours know about her diagnosis, but I am unsure if I should give them a little more prep that this is happening and that she might say something that could be considered inappropriate.

"My mum lives with my dad. He has had Alzheimer's for about five years. She acts as his full time carer, myself and my siblings live nearby and help as much as we can and we have two companions that come to keep him company and give mum a few hours respite a week.  

Dad is declining. He can chat but he only talks about the same 4 things on rotation, all from his past, and will turn any conversation to these points. He sleeps in a separate room to my mum and takes an array of weapons to bed every night - walking sticks, toilet brushes, and more recently knives. He's worried someone might break in. We've told the GP and they're changing his medications again to see if that helps to ease the paranoia. He's also started some more unusual behaviours like urinating into mugs and keeping them in his bedroom. 

Mum is the only person he truly remembers and it's almost like he stalks her. She can't do anything without him following her like a shadow. If one of us is with him and mum is out he asks constantly where she is and often goes to look for her. 

Mum is understandably finding it all really overwhelming. I'm trying to encourage her to seek therapy - she's already on antidepressants - but is there anything else I can do to help aside from be there with her or to relieve her?

Thanks",1
"My dad is very secretive about Mom’s disease progression.  If they ever had a neurologist CT, they’ve never shared the results but I seriously doubt they did.  Meaning: we have no idea what type of dementia Mom has. 

The ‘meds’ Mom take are only effective for a few hours a day at this point. She has been very tired lately & seems to be slurring her words at times over phone calls. I know each case is different & not knowing her exact diagnosis makes progression calculations tricky but what can I reasonably expect from here?

EDIT: What I’m wondering is, now that the disease has progressed beyond whatever mediation the meds could provide, will the disease progress much more quickly? I’d guess she’s Stage 5 atm.",1
After a long battle with this awful disease my wife has gone to somewhere better. I have slowly been losing my best friend for about 8 years now and it hurts. I really miss the woman she used to be before this disease took away her mind.,1
"I’m not even sure this is the right place for this but here I am. 

I’m 25 and my grandma (dad’s mom) has Alzheimer’s. I haven’t visited in a while because quite frankly, I can’t take it. Last I spoke to her (on her birthday) she seemed to remember who I was, but hardly. Last I saw her, she was…a shell. 

She took care of me growing up and was vivacious and fun and always wore bright red lipstick and carried a Louis Vuitton. I can’t help but to be desperate to remember her that way. On top of that my mental health is…not great to say the least and every time I see her or talk to her on the phone by myself (we do group calls as a family from time to time) I spiral for days. 

My mom recently saw my grandpa and saw how thin he’d gotten due to spending the past several years taking care of my grandpa and decided we’re all going to visit her this weekend. My dad visits every weekend, some months every other weekend. Usually by himself. But this weekend we’re ALL going. And I don’t want to go. I don’t want to even be doing anything else particularly fun, just as long as it prevents me from being there. 

My grandma isn’t there anymore. The woman who would pick me up from school in her purple Mercedes and take me to Souplantation and then the library isn’t there. And I’m not that little girl anymore either, but mainly it seems that’s how she remembers me. I almost want her to hold onto THAT part of me and never let it go. She’ll never know who I am NOW. 

Has anyone else struggled like this? What do you do?",1
"At what point should I start just telling my mom what she wants to hear, rather than truths that are unpleasant and which she won't remember?

Another question, regarding her dementia: how should I handle the side comments she makes when we're alone, about my dad being out to get her? I've witnessed arguments, and it's almost always my mom making mountains out of molehills, or my dad losing patience with her constantly interrupting him or hijacking his stories.",1
"My dad has shown more and more symptom since he reached age 70. He lives alone in a house and latest couple of months us siblings agrees he needs help. We have no knowledge how to go about it. Right now he's very aggressive and it's almost impossible to talk to him in a calm matter before he loose temper. Right now he says one family member is turning everyone else against him. So anytime we try to talk to him, he just gets defensive. We haven't mentioned the illness yet because we don't think he's ready to hear it.",1
"We believe she has early signs of Alzheimer’s. We can’t get her to a Doctor for any sort of official diagnosis. But the effects and symptoms are all the same. Right now she is living in an apartment close to my parents. The last place she lived was secluded and she was convinced her landlord and neighbors were spying on her and stealing from her. In this current apartment where has been for maybe 2 years she has also become convinced that people are stealing from her. Stealing things from the house, breaking in, taking her outside items and claiming them as their own. It’s obvious that she is scared and paranoid of where she is living. My parents are woken up in the middle of the night by the cops very often because she keeps calling them thinking people are stealing from her or from locking herself out of her apartment. It’s getting to the point where this stuff is happening multiple times a week. My poor father looks like he’s about to explode from stress. I should also mention that she can be very mean and manipulative by nature and has always been this way. Very stubborn. So that on top of a deteriorating mind can be very stressful I imagine. My fathers solution is buying her a beautiful trailer in and old folks home where everyone is kind of in a similar situation from her. She is not that old, nearing her 80’s and she is very mobile. But I am not sure this is a good solution. It seems the same thing would be happening if she were there.  If she lived with my parents it would be her convincing them that they were stealing from her. She will accuse who ever is in front of her. And it would be chaos. I guess I am just looking for direction on how to handle these situations. How do you prepare for a further deteriorating mind? How do you prepare for her behavior to accelerate?  I don’t understand why none of my aunts and uncles are weighing in on this.",1
My grandma has been ill for quite sometime with heart failure. she has dementia/ Alzheimer’s. I’m looking after her just for tonight and I’m worried about some of her behaviour. She keeps crying quietly and it’s really sad to see. When I ask her if there is anything she is sad about she denies she is sad even though she’s visibly crying. This is very unusual for her. Any advice I’d welcome.,1
Grandma refuses to go to bed tonight because “the rain is too loud to sleep”. I told her that was silly. She says I used to tell her that when staying with her as a child. *Applauds the moment of clarity*,1
"My mother-in-law has moderate dementia (likely Alzheimer's but no Dx). She has 4 children with varying reactions/denial about her condition. My husband & the oldest sibling admit the issue more than the other two, yet at the same time don't cope well and think they can talk her out of delusions. 

Her newest delusion is regarding her brother's passing. When he died last year, THAT wasn't handled well in telling her. She confused the news, by thinking it was her other son who died. The initial memorial was on Zoom. Then at the holidays they had an in person service in his & my mother-in-law's hometown. The kids thought that would help her process his death. 

Nope. That's when the delusion started. He's not buried in the family plot, but his wife & son are going to place a memorial headstone there. MIL thinks she has a letter somewhere from her brother stating his last wishes and she has to find it. She has told my husband and the oldest sister all kinds of nonsensical stories about how she has to deal with this. They are so frustrated that they can't logic her out of it. 

I wish I could just get my husband to understand this won't be solved with rational explanation & not to argue with her",1
"My 75 yo mother has AD and is starting to miss appointments. So far, a calendar with written appt times has been enough, but it isn’t any more.

Does anyone have advice for what we do next to maintain her independence as much as possible? Text message reminders? Phone calls? Etc.

I should clarify: these are hair/nail appts where she drives herself normally. They’re important to her.",1
"My grandmother(dads side)  was diagnosed last year with alzheimer, she is 80 years old. 2 months ago it progressed a little bit more and now she is calling every week our family members, especially my mom, that we are taking her items, such as bras, clothes and etc.. we are trying to tell her in many ways that we dont live with her, we just come to visit her and dont have any ideas to steal from her. I know its usual symptom of alzhaimers, but it is uncomfortable to other family members who are not that much in touch with her, but maybe anyone do have any ideas how to speak, how to tell that no one is coming to her home, besides her? I know its really hard to get inside her head but any tips would be great, just want to do everything I still can.  
P.s sorry for my English if I made any mistakes",1
"Our neighbour seemed to have deteriorated considerably on Friday, to the point where an ambulance crew nearly had to resort to dragging her to hospital (they didn't lol!), she was violent, confused and raving. I suggested she may have a uti, because she was presenting like alzheimers on speed! The paramedics even did a skin elasticity test and the skin just stayed where it was, leading them to suggest she wasn't hydrated enough (they had been called because she had complained of feeling dizzy and then she fell over).

She has been in hospital since then and finally, we have had a moment to drop some things up to the hospital for her. I asked whether it was a uti... and they haven't bloody tested her for it!

We feel so helpless, we are only neighbours, but I'm just glad I asked. I will phone up tomorrow and find out how the test went!",1
"My dad was diagnosed with mild/moderate Alzheimers in December 2021 after memory clinic assessment and review of brain scans from Sept 2021. We informed the DVLA of this in December 2021 and have received a holding letter to apologise for the delay in their reaction to whether it’s okay for my father to continue driving. My mother and I do not feel he is safe to drive, he had an accident in August 2021 which was entirely his fault, his reactions are not what they were and the mobility in his legs is effected (he shuffles a lot and gets cramps in his leg muscles) and we of course we informed the memory clinic nurse of our worries discreetly. As I’m sure is the case with a lot of men in their mid/late seventies who have just received this diagnosis, he says he feels no different at all and gets very defensive when we try to discuss his diagnosis and we think he hasn’t got a full grasp on what his diagnosis means (due to the condition, no doubt). Today, he received a letter from the consultant at the same memory clinic to say that he will be having a telephone assessment (due to Covid) regarding his ability to continue driving. Has this been the case for other people, he is of course going to tell the consultant and the memory clinic that he feels that he is fine to drive?! Does anyone UK based know if this is normal? He was just starting to get used to my mother being the driver and we’re desperately worried that if the NHS/DVLA tell him that he’s okay to continue driving based upon a telephone assessment (HOW CAN THEY MAKE THIS ASSESSMENT ON THE PHONE?) it will become a huge source of conflict if we try to stop him. Any UK based experience similar to this with DVLA/NHS would be greatly appreciated.",1
"My 70yo father-in-law has late-stage Alzheimer’s. He is very fond of me, always asking where I am, when I am going to his house, etc. He’s bedridden for years. Completely lost the ability to take care of himself. 

One day he suddenly told my husband he wanted to rape me (behind my back) and my husband just laughed it off and expected me to do the same, because he thinks he’s delirious and will soon die so we should be lenient. 

While I know he isn’t a threat (not sure if he means what he said though), I still feel disgusted. I told my husband I wouldn’t see him anymore because I simply don’t know what to do or what to feel. Husband feels hurt and upset with me. He thinks it will be a blow to his family. 

Any advice please? :( Really appreciate that!",1
"My grandmother does not take her depression pills. We are not sure about the cause, could be both attention seeking and simple forgetfulness, but the issue is serious as she once already had a temporary psychotic episode (thinking there are people in her house, that someone locked her inside even though she just lost her keys), due  to taking the pills and then abruptly stopping.   


Unfortunately, after that we had to get her to an old people's house as we live in a totally different city and the family that is there does not pay enough attention to her to keep her on her toes with her pills. However, she is a very assertive, and proud person so we think it is best that once she is comfortably back on her meds to let her live alone again, if she so desires.  


To that end I am looking for some intelligent contraptions, perhaps with a camera, that will track whether my grandmother actually does take her meds, and notify us wirelessly. Did any of you have experience with similar machines? Do you have any to recommend?",1
"I'd appreciate your opinions on this question. The situation is this: A couple in their late 70s, slowing down but still fully independent, have been in their current home for 10+ years, so it's very familiar, but also a bit too big for them. Wife was recently diagnosed with early onset, so anyone's guess as to how quickly things will progress. 

With the market as it is, they were thinking of selling their house and getting a condo, but now with this diagnosis, the question is should they: 

(a) stay in the house, as it's more familiar, but may not be as safe and will get more difficult to maintain, 

(b) buy a condo as planned but potentially run into issues with familiarity if the Alzheimer's progresses quickly, or 

(c) get a condo or apartment in a senior living building, with 24 hr available support on site, meals in a dining room, etc., but still risk the lack of familiarity plus the fear that being around others like this will ""age us faster"". 

I appreciate any insight into the options, or maybe other options we haven't considered.",1
"It started all of a sudden. My mom passed away on 07.07.2020. Her departure had a great impact on my dad as they were together for 42 years. From 2nd half of 2021 (June or July may be) we started observing some abnormalities like some illogical statements and questions(which were very occasional and unnoticable). But from then we noticed his excessive fascination towards sweet foods including ice creams, cakes, chocolates, candies etc. He has diabetes but he started eating candies and ice creams whenever he went out alone. I talked to the local grocery shop who informed me that Dad on average takes 5 to 10 ice creams daily. I was very annoyed on him because of this childish behavior because till then I didn't realized that he developed something like dementia or Alzheimer's. Things kept going like this till this year. Last week my dad left home in the midnight and when he got back I asked him why he left home and he couldn't answer me and he was very confused. That time I realized something is wrong with him which needs medical attention. Next day I rushed to a neurologist who told me that he has developed dementia and prescribed few medications including Donepezil Hydrochloride INN 5 mg tab once in the night, Quetiapine Fumerate 25 mg 2 tabs in the night and Ginkgo Biloba 60 MG tab twice a day. Since we started The meds he started hallucinating throughout the day. After a couple of days I contracted with the with the doc and he told me to discontinue Donepezil and continue the rest. But till today there is no progress and his deteriorating each day. I'm really confused whether this is because of the meds prescribed or his progressing so fast. Is it really possible to deteriorate within a week??
I have done extensive research for lost couple of days and discovered Alzheimer's is also termed as type 3 diabetes which leads to excessive fascination towards sweet foods because of some chemical imbalance in the brain. My doctor didn't tell me anything like this. Later I came across some researches which shows nasal insulin helps  Alzheimer's patients to some extent. I really want to try that out. Anyone ever tried Nasal insulin for Alzheimer's  or dementia?? I know it is not conclusive or approved yet, but I cannot see my dad suffering without any medical care.",1
"Partly just to vent.

My dad is doing his best to care for my mom and us kids try to share some responsibility to help when we can.  I have not seen the exact diagnosis for what my mom has...I believe my dad that it's Alzheimers but it feels like it has manifested a little differently from most peoples' experiences.  She is not yet at the point of forgetting who people are, not at all.  However she does forget the events of the day or any plans, and will ask over and over what time such-and-such is happening, unless the events are pretty significant like someone's death.  For example, every time I have seen her for the past year, she brings up how hard it must be for the family of someone who died of Covid over a year ago now.

Her main issue is overwhelmingly strong compulsions to do the few things she is still able to do.

She cannot sew, knit, do puzzles, watch TV/movies, or play games of any kind, and generally refuses to read books or just sit still.  All of these things seem to be overwhelming to her and she can't even get started on them.  This is what she can do:

* Dishes and laundry (when she feels like it, and doesn't last long)

* Check her email, Facebook, and mass-collect free eBooks (all trashy, but she has no idea; this also does not last more than a few hours per day)

* Go on long walks up and down the road picking up trash (she has never gotten lost)

* Recently, overeating any snacks she can find

If allowed to, she would walk endlessly, to the point of physically harming herself, but pain apparently doesn't register as a reason to stop.  When it's in her head, every 2 minutes she will beg and plead and find any excuse, swear that she won't walk for the rest of the week if you only let her go for a little while.  If you do extract a promise that it will be a short walk, she will go right past where you say she can (GPS tracker is a godsend).  If it was someone fully in control of their faculties, I would call it manipulative or sneaky, but it's the compulsion talking.  She takes every tiny candy wrapper all the way outside to the trash can just to get the experience of walking briefly.  For mother's day we took her to a state park to walk a trail together and on the drive home when we were all exhausted she was hinting that she wanted to go walk as soon as we got home.  She can't be left alone anymore, sometimes even when you're home with her.  Hiding shoes doesn't help, she has gone out barefoot at least once.  Locks are not really a good solution in case of emergencies.

She will also wear clothing inappropriate to the weather and takes a long period of adjustment to stop wearing coats in the heat (now) and start wearing them in the winter.  Fortunately she does seem to not want to walk when it's clearly raining or snowing, and on those days doesn't even ask.  Easiest days we have.

She likes going to any store as well, whether you need to or not.  If she can't walk, she wants to go to Wal-Marts or local bakeries, and just does a circuit with you as you pick up the few things you need (due to constant visits on her behalf).  And asks constant questions about stopping anywhere else as well.

Recently we have had to hide food because she will sneak any snacks she can find.  If you tell her to stop, she just smiles like ""oh I'm being so naughty,"" but doesn't realize she's been doing it constantly.  Yesterday when all food was out of reach, she was caught eating dog treats. :(

She was over at my house with dad today working on some outdoor chores.  Because it's unfamiliar territory she couldn't walk, and because we weren't indoors she couldn't snack.  I think she short-circuited and asked to go to the bathroom 6 times in 30 minutes, because there just wasn't anything else to do.  She also found bits of trash on the sidewalk and put it in my garbage cans even though we asked her to stop.

She is on daily pills and a few times we have given her a Tylenol PM in the morning and that has helped a ton...but this isn't really something we should do long term.  I've been curious what affect something like Adderall might have on her, but doctors will not prescribe anything other than what she is on, and just say she requires constant care.

Dad is having a terrible time.  I want to be able to do more but my sisters and I all have jobs and other demands.

Is there anything we can do about these overwhelming compulsions?  Is there any activity we haven't thought of to try to have her do that might keep her attention?",1
"My grandmother has got alzheimer's for about 1 year, I moved in with her 5months ago. I have always noticed the situation getting worse. I keep telling her something over and over until she gets it. I understand that what she say is not what she means and she'll say hurtful things and I have always not cared about her insults. But recently her situation worsened and all these methods are not working anymore. I found myself scolding her today, im so so sorry. I dont know what to do.

"Hi all! My dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s about two years ago. My mom is his only caregiver and he’s declining pretty fast. He is still able to dress himself (though it’s usually dirty laundry because he can’t remember where the clean clothes are) and his memory is about 3 minutes now. He’s starting to get a little angrier than before when he can’t remember to do something and he gets really down on himself. They are both amazing people. They live about 1.5 hours away and I try to see them as often as possible. Does anyone have advice on what to do to support the other parent? I try to call my mom as often as possible but I cannot imagine how hard this must be for her as well. She isn’t able to go out or even really leave the house. I’ve contemplated moving down there to help out (I’m an only child and our closest family is about 8 hours away) so it could make her life a little easier and she would be able to get out of the house. He’s at the point where he can’t be left alone anymore. I’m nervous I’ll regret not moving down there and helping out before things take a turn for the worse. I’m not trying to make this about myself, just having a lot of mixed emotions. Has anyone been in this situation and can give some advice? Am I overthinking everything? Has anyone moved to help take care of their parent? Please help. Thank you all in advance.",1
"As the title states, my mother (70) was diagnosed in October and is going downhill rapidly, imo.

Just last month, she was able to remember what happened that day. She was able to remember appointments she had, maybe not the exact date, but she remembered. She, pretty much, remembered what I told her during our visits.

I visited her yesterday and she's so much worse. She asked the same questions over and over. She couldn't remember what she said just minutes before. I just answered her like she'd never asked those questions before. She kept saying she needed a haircut and I'd answer, for the 4th time, that she has an appointment for next month. She couldn't remember Dr appointments she just had. I'm so afraid that next month she won't remember me. I'm so worried for her and it breaks my heart. I guess I just wanted to vent.

Also, some of you may see this twice, as I accidentally posted in r/Alzheimersgroup. I feel badly, so I deleted. I didn't know it was specifically for people with Alzheimer's.",1
"I am from Bangladesh. I lost my mom due to coronavirus in July 2020. She was then 63 years old. After departure of my mom, I slowly started witnessing some behavioral change of my dad. He is now 75 years old. Since last year he started showing some behavioral changes and instances of memory loss. Sometimes it sounded like he lost his logics. He would remember memories of decades ago but forgets recent memories like every day tasks. For last few days he was having some hallucinations. Couple of days back. He left home at midnight and after a few hours he got back and I asked him where did you go. He was staring at me like clueless and he couldn't remember why he left home in the midnight. I got very nervous and perplexed. I rushed to a neurologist who told me that he is having dementia which is probably due to Alzheimer's disease. I immediately started medicines but I am very afraid and concerned about my dad's health. Can anyone tell me at which stage he is currently in by looking into the symptoms I mentioned? How long does it usually take to graduate to next step? Please help!",1
"Hi - my dad has vascular dementia and my mum has Alzheimers.  They moved into a specialised dementia home about a month ago.  (Both are in their early 80s)  My mum  is trying hard to adjust and settle in, but dad just isn't even trying.  He says he feels perfectly fine and doesn't need to be in there ""with all the crazies"" and he wants to go home. When we try to explain to him that it's not safe at home for them, he argues and gets upset. When we try to explain why his behaviours are unsafe he says that ""he was just joking"" when he did/said [whatever it was].  He basically lacks any insight into his illness, and I just don't know how to deal with him - not to mention the intense guilt I feel about helping to move them both in (my sister and I have PoA and Guardianship) even though I know it's the right thing to do.  My mum does have some insight into her condition, which helps.  Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas on what to say when he gets upset and angry about his new situation?",1
"My 88 year old grandpa is an amazing person. Like seriously one of the most kind, hardworking, compassionate, intelligent, loving people I’ve ever known in my 27 years of life. But he is slipping more and more every day with this awful disease. He is also a Vietnam and Korean war vet. He and my grandma helped raise me; they were huge parts of my life. He has loved my grandma for 67 years, and loved her so incredibly well. He would go to the ends of the earth for her, do absolutely anything for her. He’s just as in love with her now as he was when they first fell in love, except now he doesn’t make much sense when he talks and I know eventually he’s going to forget us including her (if he doesn’t pass away first—he is 88 after all). I can’t stand it.

I can’t stand that they had to have my Aunts (their children) sell their house—the house that I frequently visited as a child and even temporarily lived in with them for a time—so they could move into a nursing home. And my grandma who is still of sound mind has to witness the love of her life decline every single day (they were placed in the same room). She’s one of the strongest people I’ve ever known.

At their old house (that now belongs to someone else), we’d drive down to the train station with Subway sandwiches and just watch the trains go by while chowing down. My grandpa was very knowledgeable about trains and locomotive history and it was fun to hear him tell me things while we sat there. The train station had a park attached to it and we’d go take walks there. I know those days are long gone and I’m an adult now, been an adult for a while, but it doesn’t make this process any easier. I’ve never lost a loved one before. This will be my first time and I know it’s going to be extremely difficult. Thank you for letting me vent, and I appreciate this subreddit; at least I know I’m not alone.",1
"My dad has been fading from Alzheimer’s / dementia for about 10 years. This last year, he’s faded a lot faster. He had been living at home until toileting issues and agitation became too much for my mom to handle, so we moved him into memory care. His toileting issues got worse, coupled with dehydration from a stomach bug, had us take him to the ER two weeks ago. He was agitated by his roommate, the staff trying to give him medicine and food. I’ve never witnessed it, but I imagine it is more “I don’t know you or why you’re trying to put that in my mouth, step back” rather than more physical violence. He was there four days recovering, came back to memory care, and they called us 45 minutes late. They’d sent him to the local hospital, who then transferred him to mental care facility under a GA1013 involuntary commitment order as “danger to others.”

Do these medical professionals not understand that “my dad doesn’t know where he is or what’s going on” is not the same as “danger to others?”

My mom has only gotten a few updates. This facility does not allow any visitors at all (because it’s where they keep people that are a “danger to others”). He’s just as agitated, dehydrated again, toilet problems continue, not eating or drinking, not “compliant” with taking his medicine.

Until he calms his agitation, relearns the toilet, eats and drinks well, and takes his medicine without complaining, he won’t be cleared for release. The 1013 involuntary commitment expired after 48 hours, so it’s “hospital discharge,” which I suppose we could override if needed. Realistically, there’s no way he’s going to significantly improve in those areas unless they find an incredibly effective combination of medicines, or just heavily sedate him.

It’s worse because my mom’s process of grieving is “accept the things that I can’t change.” I don’t blame her for that, but when I ask her for updates, she’s very brief. On Monday, she even said, “just don’t call or text me for updates anymore, I’ll let you know if anything important happens.” I have the code to call the nurses, but even with the code, it took me nine phone calls to get to a “case worker,” who said that even though I have the code, they will only talk to one family member, which is mom. That was Wednesday morning. Mom said “oh, he’s doing just fine they say.” I had gotten a little information before they shut me down, and they told me about getting IV fluids because he wasn’t eating or drinking, which mom omitted. There’s no other information since Wednesday. She came over to visit my daughter and me today for Mother’s Day, and she didn’t say anything. Didn’t mention his name. She’s changed her phone background so it’s not a picture of her and Dad anymore. I didn’t want to confront her around my daughter or make a stink for Mother’s Day. She can grieve in her way, but I don’t think it’s too much for me to ask for the information and help in his care. I’m paying for all of it. Mom said that they couldn’t really afford the memory care before he even moved in. I said I could help, and so I guess I’ll be getting the bill for two weeks in the hospital, plus what’s to come. 

My mom and dad cared for my grandmother before she died with Alzheimer’s. She never got as bad as Dad is now. He’d say, over and over, just to me, “son, don’t ever let me get like that. Just let me wander off in the woods. Buy me a one-way ticket to Vegas and $100 of chips. Shake my hand and say, ‘see you later, Dad.’”",1
